       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': \"summary  a male newborn was apparently well until his second day of life , when increased irritability and a swelling in his right leg were noted . he was rooming - in with his mother since birth . on examination , a mass on the anterior surface of the right leg was noticed . the mass was firm , elongated , ill - defined , unmovable and painful at palpation . no overlying skin changes were seen . the newborn had a family history of neonatal bone swelling with resolution before the age of 2 . subsequent images showed hyperostosis in the diaphysis of the right tibia . after exclusion of other conditions such as trauma , osteomyelitis and congenital syphilis , the involvement of the tibial diaphysis , sparing the epiphyses and the benign course of the disease in family history , were indicative of caffey disease . the genetic study confirmed this diagnosis . caffey disease , although rare , should not be overlooked in the diagnostic approach to childhood bone swelling .  background  caffey disease is a rare cause of bone swelling in a newborn . the manifestations of this disorder can sometimes resemble those of child 's physical abuse , as well as other diseases . for this reason , a correct diagnosis of the cause of unexplained trauma , fractures or swellings in children requires that clinicians be familiar with such diseases , showing the importance of well - interpreted imaging studies in these diagnoses . 1 , 2  case presentation  a male newborn was apparently well until 28 h of life when his mother identified a swelling in his right leg ( figure 1 ) . he was irritable since then . apart from the painful swollen leg , the newborn had no other systemic symptoms such as fever or poor feeding .  tumefaction in the middle third of the anterior surface of the right leg .  on examination , there was a firm tumefaction in the middle third of the anterior surface of the right leg , painful on palpation , with no changes in colour or temperature of skin over the affected limb . apart from this , the physical examination was normal . there were no external wounds or bruises .  the mother was 33 - year - old , arh + and gravida 3 para 2 . the current pregnancy was planned and uneventful . biochemical screening was negative . three routine fetal ultrasounds were normal . in the third trimester ( 34 weeks of gestational age ) , serological maternal investigation was irrelevant ( negative for hepatitis b virus , hepatitis c virus , toxoplasma , hiv and venereal disease research laboratory , vdrl ; immune to rubella ) . cytomegalovirus serology was not studied . group b streptococcus screening test was positive .  the child was born at term ( 39 weeks ) by normal vaginal delivery , non-traumatic with cephalic presentation . no history of prolonged rupture of membranes or maternal fever during labour . intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis was performed . apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min , respectively . at birth , his weight was 3490 g ( 25th – 50th percentile ) , length 50 cm ( 50th percentile ) and head circumference 35 cm ( 25th percentile ) . from birth , he was in hospital rooming - in with mother , the primary caregiver who denied any history of trauma or injury . he was exclusively breastfed since birth and not received any supplements including vitamin syrup .  he is the second child of non-consanguineous parents , with a previously healthy daughter . tracing back his family history ( figure 2 ) , mother and two maternal uncles reported a ‘ bone disease ’ manifested as a swelling - bone in the neonatal period , which resolved without sequelae in the first 2 years of life ( 24 , 12 and 5 months , respectively ) . in all cases , tibia was affected and one of the maternal uncles had involvement of other bones ( skull , legs and arms ) . no family history of multiple fractures was reported .  investigations  biochemical and haematological investigations were normal ( haemoglobin 17 g / dl , total white blood cell count 12 780 × 109 / l , platelet 335 × 109 / l , calcium ( total ) 9.7 mg / dl , phosphorous 7.4 mg / dl , urea 16 mg / dl , creatinine 0.6 mg / dl and c reactive protein 0.3 mg / dl ) .  x-rays of the affected leg showed thickening of the periosteum at tibial diaphysis without epiphysial involvement and no signs of fracture ( figure 3 ) .  anteroposterior ( ap ) and lateral ( perfil ) x-rays of right lower limb at 2 days of life , showing cortical new bone formation associated with subperiosteal thickening of tibial dyaphysis .  maternal serology for syphilis ( vdrl ) was not performed after birth .  a germinal heterozygous missense mutation c . c & gt ; t ( p . arg1014cys ) in exon 41 of col1a1 gene , associated with caffey disease , was identified in the newborn , as well as in his mother and in his uncle ( figure 2 ) .  differential diagnosis  the initial diagnosis hypothesis was trauma . in a newborn with non-traumatic vaginal delivery , cephalic presentation , with normal medical examination in first day of life and who seems well until 28 h of life when increased irritability and a swelling in his right leg were noted , trauma ( inflicted or otherwise ) must be excluded . there was a single region involved and periosteal reaction of a single bone that except for the mandible , could be suggestive of trauma .3 however , the absence of external wounds or bruises and the fact that he shared the hospital room not only with his mother but also with other people ( who denied any trauma ) under the surveillance of hospital staff , suggested otherwise .  osteomyelitis was also regarded as a possible diagnosis , due to the swollen and tender extremity . nevertheless , a bone infection was thought to be unlikely because the newborn showed good physical condition with normal vital signs and no fever . in addition , bone changes are not usually present in early acute osteomyelitis and children with osteomyelitis usually have increased acute - phase reactants ’ levels ( c reactive protein ) and possibly increased or left - shifted white blood cell count , which did not occur in this case .  despite a negative vdrl in the third trimester of pregnancy , this test was performed more than 4 weeks before delivery , not excluding a recent infection . as abnormal long - bone radiographs with diaphyseal periostitis are a common manifestation of early congenital syphilis ( 60 – 80 % ) and may even be the only manifestation in infants born to mothers with untreated syphilis , we had to consider congenital syphilis as a possible diagnosis too . however , in congenital syphilis the skeletal changes usually involve not only diaphysis but also metaphysis of the long bones and the lesions are usually symmetric . in this case , maternal serology for syphilis ( vdrl ) to exclude or confirm this diagnosis was not performed after birth .  there are other causes of periosteum thickening , including scurvy and hypervitaminosis a , but these were not considered in differential diagnosis as they usually do not affect such small infants .  after the exclusion of the conditions aforementioned , the characteristic triad of irritability , swelling and bone lesions with periosteal reaction involving the tibia diaphysis sparing the epiphyses , the age at presentation and benign family history , pointed to the caffey disease . subsequently , the genetic study confirmed this diagnosis .  treatment  symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen was given , with good clinical response . the newborn was discharged on the third day of life , keeping surveillance on an outpatient basis and with recommendation for analgesic therapy during periods of increased irritability .  outcome and follow - up  with 1 month of age , the swelling in the middle third of the right leg persisted , without other inflammatory signs , rarely requiring medication . radiography of the right leg showed worsening of hyperostosis with thickening of the cortex in the diaphysis of the right tibia ( figure 4 ) .  discussion  caffey disease or infantile cortical hyperostosis is a proliferative bone disease , resulting in new bone formation at the periosteum , sometimes exuberant , becoming compact and with a pronounced cortical thickening .  skeletal growth is a strictly controlled phenomenon . while bone growth in length is performed by adding endochondral bone formation in metaphyseal spongy bone , the growth in diameter is achieved by subperiosteal new bone apposition . the periosteum is a fibrous connective tissue capsule that covers the external surface of the bone , except articular surfaces that are covered by hyaline cartilage . periosteum has an outer layer which resembles other dense connective tissues and an inner layer , more cellular that contains the osteoprogenitor cells . the size of the marrow cavity is controlled by a combination of bone apposition versus resorption at the endocortical surface . in caffey disease , there is an exacerbated subperiosteal intramembranous bone formation ( hyperostosis ) , triggered by local inflammation ( periostitis ) . this excess of bone tissue could be resorbed either at the endocortical surface with an expansion of the marrow cavity and a more persistent deformity , or at the exocortical surface , with no effect on the size of the marrow cavity . 5  two forms of cortical hyperostosis or caffey disease have been described : prenatal and infantile . the prenatal form is characterised by extensive hyperostotic bone involvement , angulations and shortening of long bones , polyhydramnios and fetal hydrops , being a rare disorder with a high death rate due to prematurity and lung hypoplasia . the diagnosis of this form is based on ultrasound findings ( as early as 14 weeks of gestation , average 27 weeks ) of short and angulated bones with irregular diaphyses . conversely , in the reported case , the pregnancy was uneventful , with normal ultrasounds and a term delivery of a healthy newborn . consequently , the prenatal form of the caffey disease should be excluded . 6 the prenatal form of caffey disease appears to be an autosomal recessive disorder . 7 , 8  in our case , the classical mild infantile form seems more likely . it was first described in 1930 by roske ( europe ) , but was further characterised by caffey and silverman in 1945 . the classical presentation of this disease has an onset within the first 6 months of life and includes a triad of irritability , swelling and bone lesions with underlying cortical bone thickening . the swelling appears suddenly , is deep and firm , and may be tender , as occurred in our case . fever may also occur . it has been described in many bones , most often involving the mandible ( 95 % of cases ) , as well as ribs , shoulder blades and long bones ( affect only the diaphyses , sparing the epiphyses and metaphyses ) . it is often multifocal and asymmetric , 2 although cases of monostotic involvement have also been reported . 10  although the aetiology of caffey disease is not completely understood , familial and sporadic forms appear to exist . some of these sporadic cases have been attributed to administration of prostaglandins e1 and e2 for treatment of ductal - dependent cardiac lesions , with radiographs changes occurring in 62 % of all infants receiving prostaglandins infusion for more than 60 days . review of familial form , with autosomal - dominant pattern of inheritance , showed evidence of variable penetrance , as there were obligate carriers who lacked episodes of cortical hyperostosis . however , the signs and symptoms can be subtle and even missed in some of these unaffected carriers .  affected members of some families with caffey disease , including both infantile and prenatal form , were found to be heterozygous for a missense mutation ( c . c & gt ; t ) in exon 41 of the gene encoding the α1 chain of type i collagen ( col1a1 , 17q21 ) , altering residue 836 ( r836c ) in the triple - helical domain of this chain . 2 , 6 – 9 this mutation was identified in our newborn , as well as in his mother and in his uncle .  the col1a1 gene is responsible for other collagen diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and ehlers - danlos syndrome , and for this reason , studies place the caffey disease in the family of type i collagen - related diseases . 2 , 11  caffey disease is rare , being reported to affect 3 per 1000 children under 6 months , with no sex or racial predilection . it has a low prevalence , probably due to underdiagnosis .  diagnosis may be delayed as this disorder mimics a wide range of diseases , including osteomyelitis , chronic hypervitaminosis a , bone tumour , scurvy and prolonged pge1 infusion . the effects of caffey disease can also resemble those of child physical abuse . however , a misdiagnosis of child abuse can also pose a significant burden to the child , the parents and the suspected aggressor , being of crucial importance that clinics be aware of other conditions that may mimic a non-accidental injury , such as infantile hyperostosis . 7 , 12  while no laboratory tests are specific for diagnosis of infantile cortical hyperostosis , 7 radiography is the most valuable diagnostic study in infantile cortical hyperostosis , showing layers of periosteal new bone formation , with cortical thickening . soft - tissue swelling is evident as well . other diagnostic imaging studies have not proved to be helpful .  awareness of the existence of this rare condition and its typical clinicoradiological profile will avoid the patient being subjected to unnecessary investigation and treatment .  no specific treatment exists for caffey disease . management is mainly palliative , aimed at pain relief . some authors described a good response to immunoglobulin , corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory , but generally these agents do not have any effect on the bone lesions . for this reason , there is no consensus on its use .  caffey disease is a self - limited disease , sometimes with periods of exacerbation / remission and usually resolves without sequelae by 2 years . however , when paired bones such as tibia and fibula , or radius and ulna , are affected , cross-fusion may be a long - term complication . 10 although some authors refer that the bone changes persist into adolescence and adulthood , others as gensure et al report that studied patients with col1a1 mutations had no skeletal deformity after childhood . in the study of four generations of a family affected with caffey disease ( cerruti - mainardi et al13 ) , col1a1 mutation was identified in nine members of this family , reaching all target height and showing no bone changes sequelae in adulthood .\",\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': 'summary  re- expansion pulmonary edema ( rpe ) is a rare but potentially fatal complication that can occur following rapid lung expansion while managing patients with pleural effusion or pneumothorax . in this case , fatal outcome occurred due to rpe in a previously healthy young adult male patient subsequent to tube thoracostomy for spontaneous pneumothorax . while managing patients with pneumothorax or large pleural effusions , precautions should be taken to avoid rapid re-expansion of the previously collapsed lung in order to reduce the probability of development of this complication .  background  re- expansion pulmonary edema ( rpe ) is a rare complication which is attributed to the rapid drainage of air or fluid from the pleural cavity . it has been reported to occur following either thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy . the attributed pathological mechanism is the abrupt reduction in the intrapleural pressure , especially as a result of extensive and rapid pneumothorax / pleural effusion drainage or rapid pulmonary expansion in cases where long - term pulmonary collapse has been present . these patients may develop varying degrees of hypoxia and hypotension and occasionally , pulmonary oedema which becomes bilateral , and the patient may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation . rarely , the syndrome is fatal in otherwise healthy , young adult subjects without any underlying comorbid illnesses who develop this complication .  case presentation  a 20 - year - old male patient presented to the emergency department at another healthcare centre with a history of sudden onset shortness of breath and left side chest pain , persistent for 5 days . the pain was sudden in onset , pleuritic in character and was not associated with radiation to any site . there was no history of fever , haemoptysis , wheezing , expectoration or any other comorbid illnesses . at the time subsequent to a chest radiograph ( figure 1 , left panel ) , a diagnosis of large left side spontaneous pneumothorax was made and an intercostal tube was inserted . following tube thoracostomy , the patient developed worsening cough and shortness of breath associated with expectoration of pink frothy sputum . as there was progressive worsening of symptoms , the patient was referred to our centre .  ( left panel ) posteroanterior chest radiograph showing the presence of a large left side pneumothorax with near total collapse of the underlying left lung . ( right panel ) chest radiograph following tube thoracostomy demonstrating unilateral alveolar opacities in the left hemithorax confirming the diagnosis of re-expansion pulmonary edema .  at time of examination in the emergency room , the patient was cyanosed and pulse oximetric saturation ( spo2 ) was 80 % while breathing oxygen ( fio2 50 % ) with venturi mask . his pulse rate was 120 / min , respiratory rate 35 bpm with visible use of accessory muscles of respiration and blood pressure was 90 / 68 mm hg . coarse crepitations were audible in the left infrascapular and axillary areas . rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable . chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse alveolar infiltrates on the left hemithorax suggestive of unilateral pulmonary oedema ( figure 1 , right panel ) . a diagnosis of rpe was made .  the patient was endotracheally intubated , mechanical ventilation was initiated and he was immediately shifted to respiratory intensive care unit . mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume , high fio2 and peep ( positive end expiratory pressure ) was delivered . simultaneously supportive treatment , intravenous fluids and inotropes to maintain haemodynamic parameters were started . despite the best available supportive treatment and mechanical ventilation , the patient developed refractory hypoxaemia and worsening haemodynamic instability . refractory ventricular fibrillation ensued from which the patient could not be revived and the patient expired .  discussion  rpe may be considered an iatrogenic complication because of rapid emptying of the pleural cavity which leads to rapid re-expansion of the collapsed lung . pinault in 1853 first reported re- expansion oedema following pleural fluid aspiration and since then many reports of re- expansion oedema following pleural fluid aspiration have been reported . in 1959 , carlson et al3 reported rpe in the setting of pneumothorax . in the following years , there were several case reports on the occurrence of rpe after drainage of spontaneous pneumothorax , resection of mediastinal tumours , thoracoscopy or talc pleurodesis . the reported incidence of rpe following drainage of pleural effusion / pneumothorax is between 0 % and 1 % . this is likely an underestimate as the syndrome of rpe may be silent and only manifest radiologically in some cases . young patients ( 20 – 40 years of age ) with large pneumothorax and duration of pneumothorax greater than 7 days have been reported to be at the greatest risk of development of rpe .  the proposed pathological mechanism in rpe is increased capillary permeability , which is evident from the high protein content of the oedema fluid , in both animal and human studies .  mechanical stresses to the lung during re- expansion cause damage to the capillary wall and leads to oedema formation . another proposed possible mechanism is reperfusion injury due to reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . however , several animal studies7 – 9 had shown a decrease in neutrophilic infiltration but not the amount of oedema when ros - scavenging compounds such as dimethylthiourea , catalase or superoxide dismutase were administered in experimental situations .  in humans , most cases of rpe develop when pneumothorax or pleural effusion have been present for at least 3 days and when negative pressure in the form of suction have been applied to the pleural space . symptoms of rpe are pernicious coughing or chest tightness during or immediately after tube thoracostomy or thoracentesis which are progressive for 12 – 24 h. serial chest radiographs reveal progressive unilateral pulmonary oedema , which may progress to involve the contralateral lung . treatment is primarily supportive , with the administration of supplemental oxygen and diuretics , and endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation depending upon the individual case scenarios . administration of cpap ( continuous positive airway pressure ) within the first hour of the development of the syndrome was effective in one case report . 10 although most of the patients recover within 5 – 7 days , death rates may reach as high as 20 % in patients who develop this complication . 6 a literature review in 1988 revealed 53 cases of rpe with a fatality rate of 21 % ( n = 11 ) .  rpe can be fatal as highlighted by the index case ; therefore , the major focus should be on the prevention of its occurrence . while performing tube thoracostomy for spontaneous pneumothorax , the tubes should initially be connected to an underwater - seal drainage apparatus rather than to negative suction . if underwater - seal drainage does not cause re-expansion of the underlying lung within 24 – 48 h , then negative pressure ( preferably & lt ; 20 cm h2o ) can be applied to the pleural space . 6 if a patient develops tightness of the chest or experiences coughing during thoracentesis , the procedure should be terminated . 12 the volume of fluid drained during thoracentesis should usually be limited to 1 – 1.5 litres . rpe as a diagnostic possibility must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with a large pneumothorax or pleural effusion who develops worsening respiratory symptoms following tube thoracostomy or thoracentesis .',\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': 'invasive lobular carcinoma ( ilc ) of breast is known to present with atypical clinical findings in the breast , making it difficult to diagnose . it is also known to have unusual sites of metastases arising de novo or in patients treated for known ilc . skin lesion in axilla could be a cutaneous metastasis from ilc or ilc in ectopic breast tissue ( ebt ) . we present two cases with skin lesion in axillas which after excision were surprisingly reported as ilc . on further investigations these were found to be primary in ebt . though such cases are reported , carcinoma arising from ebt is a very rare presentation and one should be aware of this , when dealing with a skin lesion  background  invasive lobular carcinoma ( ilc ) of the breast can present as diffuse swelling , ill - defined mass or thickening of breast , making the diagnosis difficult . it can also be difficult to diagnose with mammography because of subtle changes that mimic normal breast parenchyma , or a mass that is poorly delineated . sometimes , it can present as metastatic deposits from a very small primary breast lesion . ilc of the breast is known to metastasise to unusual sites , including gastrointestinal tract , 2 gynaecological tract ( particularly ovary ) 2 and skin . it has also been reported in ectopic breast tissue ( ebt ) , which can present as a cutaneous lesion , 4 exemplified by two cases presented here . any skin lesion in axilla should certainly be sent for histology and ilc should be one of the differential diagnoses . as it happened in our cases , the diagnosis came as a surprise .  case presentation  case 1  a 51 - year - old lady presented to general physician with pea sized nodule in her right axilla , which he excised . this was reported as ilc grade 2 . on examination in our breast clinic after excision , there was some lumpiness in her right breast with a scar in the axillary region . histological review showed adjacent breast tissue , some of which showed lobular neoplasia in situ . this was thought to represent , a primary ilc arising within ebt . the ilc was incompletely excised .  case 2  a 33 - year - old woman , presented with boils all over her body and a swelling in the left axilla in the 16th week of her third pregnancy . a pelvic ultrasound picked up a right ovarian mass . she had caesarean section and excision of right cystic ovarian mass , which was reported as a benign tumour possibly a luteoma of pregnancy . the lump in her left axilla was later excised , 2 months after delivery , which was reported as grade 1 ilc in ebt . there was no palpable abnormality in the breasts .  investigations  case 1  bilateral mammogram and ultrasound ( us ) of the right breast showed no suspicious lesion . us of right axilla showed one indeterminate enlarged lymph node , the us - guided fine needle aspiration cytology ( fna ) of which showed no malignant cells . mri of breasts showed focal area of enhancement in the lower half of the right breast suspicious of carcinoma . us - guided fna of this was non-malignant . ct scan showed no evidence of metastases .  case 2  bilateral mammogram and mri of her breast did not find a ‘ primary ’ . histological review of the ovarian lesion was thought to represent metastasis from lobular cancer . staging ct scan and bone scan did not reveal any metastases elsewhere .  treatment  case 1  she went on to have us - marked right breast wide local excision ( wle ) of the lesion seen on mri , excision of right axillary scar and sentinel node biopsy . histology from both the axillary scar and the breast wle showed benign tissue and the lymph node was negative . she was referred to oncologist for radiotherapy of the breast and axilla and endocrine therapy .  case 2  later , she had a re-excision of axillary area , along with axillary nodal clearance . two of 16 nodes showed metastatic deposits . there was residual cancer which was completely excised . as the excised ovary was the only site of known metastasis and in view of her young age and triple negative cancer , she received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to breast , axilla and supraclavicular fossa .  outcome and follow - up  discussion  at 5 weeks of gestation , an ectodermal ridge called ‘ milk line ’ develops on the ventral aspect of the trunk of the embryo , which if it does not disappear normally , ebt is formed , with varying degrees of clinical expression . 5 the incidence of ebt is unknown , but it is believed to be about 1 % . ebt is subject to all of the physiological and pathological changes of the normal breast , including carcinoma .5  ebt , which includes both supernumerary and aberrant breast tissue , is the most common congenital abnormality of the breast . supernumerary breast tissue is seen mostly along the milk line extending from the axilla to the inguinal region , 5 , 6 the axilla , chest wall and vulva being the most common sites . aberrant breast tissue is mammary glandular parenchyma found in the region of , but beyond the usual anatomic extent of the breast . when it is presented without the nipple , located beyond the periphery of the gland , it is frequently misdiagnosed as a subcutaneous lesion .  ebt is frequently bilateral and its presence should prompt evaluation for a contralateral counterpart . ebt stays dormant until puberty and is often noticed only during pregnancy or lactation , as hormonal stimulation can cause engorgement in ebt . 5 , 8  carcinoma of ebt accounts for about 0.3 – 0.6 % of all breast cancers . there have been several reports of these in the literature . the diagnosis of carcinoma arising from ebt can be difficult and without a nipple or areolar complex , in the axilla or extra-axillary region , it is frequently confused with a subcutaneous nodule . early diagnosis relies on histology from the lesion since the clinical diagnosis is unreliable . if unaccompanied by a nipple – areolar complex , the mass may be misdiagnosed as a lipoma , lymph node , sebaceous cyst or hidradenitis suppurativa .  carcinoma arising from ebt is diagnosed like regular breast carcinoma using clinical examination , us , rarely mammography , fna , core - needle biopsy or excision biopsy . physical examination and axillary us are appropriate especially for the evaluation of axillary breast tissue . standard mammograms do not usually show ebt because of its location , but with special positioning of the patient , they are sometimes imaged . mri has been reported to be more sensitive than mammography and us in the detection of ilc and assessing disease extent before surgery .  wle and regional lymph node staging , 8 followed by radiation therapy , chemotherapy or endocrine therapy , based on tumor , node , metastasis staging and hormone receptor status , is the best treatment option . adjuvant radiation therapy to the axilla ( as that is the region of primary site of the cancer ) is given to minimise the risk of locoregional recurrence .  the decision to include ipsilateral breast irradiation should be based on pathological interpretation of the tumour to exclude surrounding lymph node tissue and information derived from breast us and mri scans to ascertain the possibility of a primary tumour within the normal breast . if any level of uncertainty exists about the nature of the ectopic origin , then ipsilateral breast irradiation should be included as part of the treatment plan , as was done in our case . the evidence for benefit of irradiation of the ipsilateral breast is less clear .  lymphatic exploration is based on the location of the ectopic breast and known patterns of drainage , as described by sappey . 10 lesions above a 2 - cm wide , circumferential periumbilical band at the 12th rib are predicted to drain to the axillary nodes , whereas lesions below this band are predicted to drain to the inguinal nodes . lymphatic drainage of the ectopic breast may be unpredictable .  with the location of the primary tumour in the axilla , radionuclide injection would create unacceptable shine - through . for that reason , radionuclide and blue dye could be injected into the retroareolar region . a small amount of blue dye could also be injected around the tumour .  although there are no prognostic conclusions available because of the rarity of this disease , carcinoma in ebt , seems to have a poorer prognosis than cancer in normal breast parenchyma . 6 this is thought to be because early diagnosis is difficult and also it may metastasise to lymph nodes earlier and more frequently than normal breast carcinoma .',\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': \"constrictive pericarditis  summary  we present a case of constrictive pericarditis that was especially difficult to diagnose . the patient presented with generalised oedema , dyspnoea and pleural effusions . history was significant for prior polysubstance abuse but was otherwise unremarkable . physical examination revealed only jugular venous distention . ct demonstrated a normal pericardium with pleural effusions . echocardiography showed mildly elevated right ventricular pressures with dyssynergic motion of the ventricular septum . no intervention was being carried out , but 1 month later further evaluation with a right and left heart catheterisation showed the classical square - root sign with equalisation of diastolic pressures in both ventricles as well as ventricular interdependence . idiopathic constrictive pericarditis was thus diagnosed with a subsequent pericardial stripping which confirmed a thickened pericardium encasing the heart .  background  this patient did not have any risk factors such as thoracic radiation , chemotherapy , thoracic surgery or tuberculosis . imaging with both echocardiography and ct did not reveal a thickened pericardium . it was not until a high index of suspicion and subsequent cardiac catheterisation that a diagnosis was made . this case highlights the need to consider an early diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis , in spite of no risk factors , as most cases are idiopathic in nature .  case presentation  a 48 - year - old man with no significant medical history presented with a 3 - week history of acute onset of dyspnoea on exertion progressing to dyspnoea at rest and associated with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea , orthopnoea and peripheral oedema . he denied fever , cough or chest pain . vital signs were stable with an oxygen saturation of 98 % on room air. physical examination demonstrated jugular venous distension and dullness to percussion bilaterally at the lung bases . a chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions . ecg showed normal sinus rhythm with non-specific t - wave abnormalities . echocardiogram was significant for dyssynergic movement of the septum and mildly increased right ventricular systolic pressures ( rvsp ) at 33 mm hg . ejection fraction was preserved , no valvular abnormalities were seen and the pericardium was unremarkable . thoracentesis revealed an exudative effusion . he was subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with levofloxacin and diuretics . there was an initial improvement in the symptoms ; however , the patient required recurrent thoracentesis several months later . exudative effusions with predominant lymphocytes and negative cytology were noted . further investigations showed negative gram stain and negative cultures for bacteria , fungus and acid - fast bacilli . tuberculin - purified protein derivative test was also negative . repeat echocardiogram was unchanged . six months after the initial presentation the patient presented complaining of severe dyspnoea at rest associated with generalised oedema . physical examination now showed normal vitals , jugular venous distention with no kussmaul 's sign , distant heart sounds with no murmurs or rubs and decreased breath sounds in the inferior 2 / 3rd of the right lung with dullness to percussion . there were no signs of ascites or hepatosplenomegaly . pitting oedema was present in both the lower extremities extending to the sacrum and the abdominal wall .  investigations  repeat ct showed stable appearance of the thorax with a moderate - to - large right pleural effusion , right lower lobe atelectatic changes with superimposed consolidation versus airspace disease and a small effusion on the left . a small amount of perihepatic ascites was present and was slightly increased since previous examination . no calcification or effusion within the pericardium were noted . complete blood count ( cbc ) was unremarkable , comprehensive metabolic panel revealed borderline low na at 135 mmol / l ( 135 – 145 mmol / l ) , elevated total bilirubin 1.6 mg / dl ( 0.1 – 1.1 mg / dl ) with elevated direct bilirubin 0.6 mg / dl ( 0.0 – 0.3 mg / dl ) , elevated γ - glutamyl transferase at 276 units / l and elevated alkaline phosphatase at 283 units / l ( 20 – 130 units / l ) . cardiac enzymes were normal and brain natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) was slightly above normal at 175 pg / ml ( 0 – 125 pg / ml ) . urine analysis showed elevated protein 22.3 mg / dl ( 0.0 – 11.8 mg / dl ) and elevated specific gravity 1.023 ( 1.008 to 1.022 ) . duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities was negative for deep venous thrombosis . owing to recurrent pleural effusions of unknown origin a right - sided video - assisted thoracoscopy ( vats ) with pleural biopsy and talc pleurodesis were performed which removed 2700 cc of yellow pleural fluid . frozen section performed during the time of surgery revealed chronic lymphocytic pleuritis with no malignancy . repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55 – 60 % with no regional wall motion abnormalities , wall thickness was increased and the rvsp was estimated at 27 mm hg . the pericardium and the valves were unremarkable ; however , the ventricular septum was noted to have dyssynergic motion , again .  differential diagnosis  the patient had signs and symptoms of heart failure upon initial presentation . however , the echocardiographic findings presented a conundrum . although he seemingly improved with diuresis . the recurrent pleural effusions were exudative in nature , which did not fit with the diagnosis of heart failure . imaging did not demonstrate any specific diagnosis , and although there was calcification of the pericardium it was not enough to warrant being described as calcified and was thought to fall within a normal range ( figure 1 ) .  restrictive cardiomyopathy was also considered . although there are haemodynamic measurements that can differentiate this from constrictive pericarditis , 1 occasionally an endomyocardial biopsy must be performed . ultimately , pericardial stripping of thick adherent pericardium can solidify the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis . 2 , 3  treatment  concern for constrictive pericarditis was raised and a left and right heart catheterisation was performed . the findings were consistent with constrictive pericarditis ( figures 2 and 3 ) . pericardiectomy was performed which revealed a thick , fibrous and densely adherent pericardium constricting the heart ( figure 4 ) . pathology revealed a pericardium of 0.3 cm thickness and chronic fibrosing pericarditis which was negative for malignancy .  outcome and follow - up  his postoperative course was unremarkable and he was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5 . subsequent follow - up revealed resolution of the anasarca and slow resolution of the pleural effusions .  discussion  this case highlights the need for high index of suspicion to rule out constrictive pericarditis , especially in patients without risk factors . in industrialised countries , idiopathic pathology represents the majority of cases , 42 – 46 % . our over reliance on cardiac imaging to pick up a diagnosis , resulted in unwarranted procedures , that is , vats . while abnormal septal motion was noted on the first echocardiogram , there was a low index of suspicion for constrictive pericarditis at that time . as this patient did not have a ventricular conduction delay , it was an unexplained finding . perhaps greater emphasis on this finding with a higher index of suspicion , earlier on , may have led to an expedited diagnosis . also the bnp being slightly above normal has been shown to help differentiate between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy . bnp is ‘ nearly normal ’ in constrictive pericarditis while in restrictive cardiomyopathy bnp is grossly elevated and averages 825.8 pg / ml .  recent studies have examined the utility of cardiac mri . the results from these studies show that this is still a growing field but does not rule in or out a diagnosis . currently , the latest guidelines from europe on pericardial disease , 9 address this modality as yet another tool at a physicians ’ disposal . however this was unavailable at our institution .  despite the delay in diagnosis a literature search revealed that this is not an isolated occurrence . 10 – 14 though some studies do outline how to diagnose constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy via imaging whether with ultrasound , 15 – 17 ct18 or mri , 7 , 8 none of them are 100 % sensitive or specific . demonstration of cardiac pressure waveforms during respiration remains the best way to assess cardiac filling pressures which can lead to a diagnosis . 19 moreover haemodynamic measurements may not be enough to distinguish between restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis . ultimately , tissue may be necessary ; an endomyocardial biopsy for restrictive cardiomyopathy or pericardial stripping versus a biopsy for constrictive pericarditis . 2 , 3  the treatment for constrictive pericarditis is the removal of the pericardium . however this surgical procedure carries a very high mortality , currently 6 % and not infrequently time is needed for normal cardiac function to return . transient constrictive pericarditis has been described , in which the constriction resolved with the medical therapy alone in 8.3 weeks on an average20 and should be considered before sending the patient for a surgery .  in summary , constrictive pericarditis remains difficult to diagnose ; however , with high clinical suspicion and newer imaging modalities available , prompt diagnosis is possible .\",\n",

blood pressure , 160 / 90 ; pulse , 85 bpm . detailed neurological examination did not show any focal deficit . there was no neck stiffness or other signs of meningeal irritation .  investigations  initial laboratory studies were unremarkable including normal white cell count , erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c reactive protein . urgent ct of the brain did not show any abnormality . cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) analysis showed no white or red blood cells , and normal chemistry . xanthochromia and microbiology studies were negative . mri of the brain was unremarkable ( figure 1 ) . mra showed focal narrowing in intracerebral arteries ( figure 2a , b ) .  differential diagnosis  treatment  outcome and follow - up  discussion  the actual prevalence of rcvs is unknown . the disease predominantly affects individuals between 20 and 50 years of age . 1 – 4 however , children can be affected as well . in the literature there are five cases of rcvs in the paediatrics population , all of them were men . 5 – 7 rcvs occurs more commonly in women than men with female to male ratios ranging from 2.6 : 1 to 10 : 1 . the female preponderance appears to be less significant in secondary forms of rcvs . the exact pathogenesis of rcvs remains unclear ; however , sympathetic over activity may have a role to play .  the disease can be either spontaneous or precipitated by several factors . vasoactive drugs and the postpartum period are two common associations . 4 the disease has also been linked to the use of immunosuppressant and cytotoxic drugs . the spontaneous cases account for approximately one - third of patients , and precipitating factor can be identified in the remaining two - thirds .  studies have shown that thunderclap headache is the only presenting symptom in 76 – 85 % of patients . the headache tends to be recurrent in up to 94 – 100 % of patients , and they are the most important clinical feature of rcvs . the headache may occur spontaneously or provoked by exercise . valsalva manoeuvres tend to exacerbate the pain . nausea , vomiting , confusion , blurred vision and transient hypertension often accompany the headache . focal neurological deficits were present initially in 43 % and generalised tonic – clonic seizures occurred in 17 % .  digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard investigation . 2 however , it is invasive and not practical for frequent imaging which may be required to assess for reversibility of the vasospasm . additionally , transient neurological deficits occurred in 9 % of patients following catheter angiography in one large study . mra is an acceptable alternative for evaluation of the vasoconstriction in patients with rcvs . ct angiogram ( cta ) can also be used to assess the intracerebral vessels but the exposure to radiation limits its use .  the csf is usually normal , but it may show slight abnormalities such as pleocytosis of up to 15 nucleated cells , small numbers of red cells and / or minimally increased protein level .  transcranial doppler ultrasound may be used to predict which patients will develop ischaemic complications after rcvs diagnosis is performed . it has good potential in monitoring larger vessel vasospasm . mean flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery ( mca ) more than 120 m / s was associated with increased risk of ischaemic complications . 10  in the french cohort , the incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage ( sah ) that complicates rcvs was found to be 22 % . these sahs tend to be superficial , multiple , short segmental with disproportionate wide - spread vasoconstriction . on the contrary , sah - induced vasospasm is more commonly long segmental and mainly around the bleeding focus . 11  other complications include intracerebral haemorrhage ( 6 % ) , posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy ( 9 % ) , transient ischaemic attack ( tia ) ( 16 % ) and cerebral infarction ( 4 % ) , often in the watershed areas . the haemorrhagic events tend to occur during the first week while the ischaemic complications take place later during the second week . the follow - up series of the french cohort described 34 % incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage . 12  a recent study showed that about 12 % of patients with rcvs also had an associated cervical artery dissection . as a consequence , systematic imaging of the cervical carotid and vertebral arteries is necessary in patients with rcvs . 13  rcvs shares the same angiographic appearance with pacns and the differentiation between the two entities can be very challenging . patients with pacns present with a history of dull headaches , usually have an insidious course of progressive neurological deterioration in contrast to rcvs which present with acute headache and is usually self - limited disease . csf analysis usually demonstrates inflammatory changes in cases of pacns with elevated protein above 100 mg / dl and leucocytosis ; however , none of these findings is specific for pacns . 14 – 16 the sensitivity of brain biopsy for pacns is approximately 75 % . in addition to early follow - up angiography , the distinction between rcvs and pacns is possible with thorough clinical assessment including careful history and csf examination .  at the present time the evidence for treatment in rcvs is limited to observational studies . the offending medications should be discontinued in patients with secondary rcvs . bed rest is very useful in reducing headache severity . nimodipine has been reported to ameliorate the headache in 64 – 83 % of patients . however , it showed no benefit over symptom control . magnesium sulfate has also been tried with favourable outcome . steroid , although previously regarded to be a potential treatment , recent study has shown poor outcome on those who received steroids for the treatment of rcvs .  there was no recurrence in the french cohort , however , the study that was conducted in taiwan demonstrated 8 % recurrence rate over the mean 25 months follow - up . 3 , 20  the prognosis is uncertain , however , in most of the patients rcvs appears to be self - limiting . stroke is the major determinant of persistent morbidity . studies have reported between 7 % and 50 % risk of stroke in patients with rcvs . 21 – 23',\n",

( c ) higher magnification of the retinal anlage and pigment epithelium ( × 100 ) . ( d ) neuroglial tissue with cell bodies of neurons ( × 100 ) .  outcome and follow - up  the postoperative course remained uneventful . the newborn and his mother were discharged on the fifth postoperative day in a healthy condition . the mother continues to attend follow - up and at 3 months since the delivery , is currently doing well .  discussion  teratomas are germ cell tumours composed of various cell types representing different embryonic germ layers . they range from benign cystic lesions ( mature ) to those that are solid and malignant ( immature ) . the term ‘ dermoid cyst ’ , commonly used as a synonym for mature cystic teratoma , is appropriate only for those examples composed exclusively of epidermal elements with adnexal structures . 1 , 2  mct accounts for 95 % of all ovarian germ cell tumours . most of the cases are diagnosed during the reproductive period with mean age of presentation at 32 years , a finding consistent with our case . in 10 – 15 % cases , these tumours are bilateral . majority of mcts have 46 , xx chromosomal constitution and arise parthenogenetically from pleuripotent postmeiotic ovarian germ cells . the presence of barr bodies ( nuclear sex chromatin ) in the tumour cells bear testimony to the above fact .  although patients may complain of non-specific symptoms like abdominal distension and pain , the larger proportion of cases remain asymptomatic and are only discovered incidentally either during pelvic examination or surgery for other indications . in rare instances , mcts may become overtly symptomatic due to excessive ectopic hormone production or the onset of complications . the latter includes torsion , rupture , infection , malignant transformation and immune haemolytic anaemia . during pregnancy , the ovaries rise out of the pelvis due to stretching by the gravid uterus and this displacement coupled with increased mobility predispose to torsion . 6 this probably explains the reason for infraumbilical pain that our patient presented with .  mcts can frequently arise in combination with other ovarian neoplasms ; such association is the commonest with mucinous cystadenoma ( in around 40 % cases ) . also multiple mcts can arise in the same ovary simultaneously . these points deserve the pathologists ’ as well as the clinicians ’ attention .  histopathologically , one may find a variety of mature tissues in mcts . the presence of ectodermal , mesodermal and endodermal elements is noted in approximately 100 % , 93 % and 71 % cases of ovarian mcts , respectively . keratinised stratified squamous epithelium with adnexa ( hair follicle , sebaceous and sweat glands ) almost universally line the cyst wall . other commonly observed tissues include adipose tissue , smooth muscles , cartilage , cerebrum , peripheral nerves and respiratory epithelium . tissues that are rarely present ( less than 5 % cases ) in mcts are the retina , kidney , liver , cardiac muscle , striated muscle and prostate .  several authors have reported the presence of retinal tissue in ovarian mct and in almost all of them this has been an incidental finding . however , no concrete evidence is available on whether the presence of this element is associated with any prognostic or therapeutic significance and this remains a potential area for the future research . mercur et al , 9 who observed retinal tissue in a developing eye in immature teratoma of the ovary advocated extensive tumour sampling whenever such uncommon elements are found in mct , to rule out the presence of any immature component as it adversely affects the prognosis and changes the approach to treatment .  mcts are extremely slow growing tumours with an average growth rate of 1.8 mm per year . this fact has prompted investigators to advocate non-surgical management of smaller tumours ( & lt ; 6 cm in size ) when diagnosed in pregnancy . 10 larger tumours need to be resected , either in the second trimester or alongside caesarean section or in early puerperium . however , if complications set in , urgent surgical intervention may be required irrespective of the period of gestation .',\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': \"summary  renal artery aneurysm ( raa ) affects & lt ; 0.01 % of the general population . rupture of raa is a rare catastrophe that can complicate pregnancy and is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality . presentation is usually acute with severe flank pain , with or without haematuria , and haemodynamic instability requiring exploration and nephrectomy . a 26 - year - old pregnant woman had sudden onset of gross haematuria and on evaluation was found to have a left raa with an intrapelvic rupture and thinned out renal parenchyma . in view of the high risk of surgery , she was managed with endovascular placement of an amplatzer type ii vascular plug . immediate and complete occlusion of blood flow was achieved and nephrectomy was avoided . follow - up doppler ultrasound revealed a reduced 5 cm mass in the left renal fossa with no internal flow and plug in position . she is currently on follow - up with 3 – 6 monthly ultrasonography not requiring any intervention .  background  a ruptured renal artery aneurysm ( raa ) is a rare cause of haematuria in pregnant patients . owing to the rarity of this condition , the diagnosis may not be considered and the resulting delay may increase the risk of mortality . such cases are usually managed by open surgery and nephrectomy . since the patient was haemodynamically stable and there was considerable risk associated with nephrectomy , an endovascular approach was preferred .  case presentation  a 26 - year - old woman ( g3p2l2a0 ) in the 14th week of pregnancy had a sudden onset of left flank pain associated with gross haematuria of 10 days duration . there was no history of trauma , surgical intervention or any other medical comorbidity . she had previous two normal full - term vaginal deliveries 3 and 6 years ago . there was an associated significant drop in haemoglobin to 3 g / dl that required 6 units of packed cell transfusion to maintain haemodynamics . on presentation , she was afebrile and haemodynamically stable with no active haematuria . her blood pressure was 112 / 76 mm hg and haemoglobin was 7.5 g / dl . abdominal examination revealed a 10 cm pulsatile mass in the left flank with no signs of peritonitis .  investigations  the patient was evaluated with ultrasonography ( usg ) and mri which revealed a 14 × 10 × 10 cm pseudoaneurysm of the left main renal artery with an intrapelvic rupture and significant compression and displacement of the left renal parenchyma . there was no functional renal parenchyma on the left side and the right kidney was normal except for physiological hydronephrosis . pelvic images revealed a single fetus of 14 – 15 weeks gestation . ( figure 1 ) .  differential diagnosis  treatment  the patient was haemodynamically stable and there was no active haematuria . the presence of a large high flow aneurysm arising from the main trunk of the left renal artery made open nephrectomy technically challenging . thus , it was decided to treat the aneurysm endovascularly and proceed to nephrectomy if it failed and to terminate pregnancy medically once stable in view of radiation exposure . digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) was performed via the left brachial artery and the left renal artery was selectively cannulised . the angiogram showed a large high - flow aneurysm in the main left renal artery but vasculature and renal parenchyma distal to the aneurysm were not visible ( figure 2a ) . in view of the large diameter of the artery ( 9 mm ) , high flow into the aneurysm and no functioning renal parenchyma , it was decided to plug the main renal artery with an amplatzer vascular plug type ii . we chose a 12 mm type ii plug which was deployed into the main renal artery and complete occlusion was immediately achieved ( figure 2b ) . she developed low - grade fever the following day and follow - up doppler ultrasonography confirmed the absence of flow . once stable pregnancy was medically terminated on day 3 , she was discharged in a stable condition .  digital subtraction angiography performed via the left brachial artery with selective cannulation of the left renal artery . ( a ) angiogram showing a large aneurysm arising from the main renal artery ( arrow ) with a guide wire placed in it . ( b ) flush angiogram performed after deployment of the vascular plug showing complete embolisation . ( inset : amplatzer type ii plug ) . ( c ) contrast - enhanced ct scan performed at 4 weeks follow - up showing a large pseudoaneurysm in the left renal fossa with no blood flow ( white arrow ) and vascular plug in position ( black arrow ) .  outcome and follow - up  after 3 months of follow - up , she is symptom free . ct angiography at 4 weeks revealed a reduced 9 × 9 cm mass in the left renal fossa with no blood flow in the left renal artery with a vascular plug in its position ( figure 2c ) . doppler study at 3 months revealed a further reduction to 5 cm in size and no internal flow . she is currently asymptomatic and on regular follow up with ultrasonography at 3 – 6 monthly intervals .  discussion  raa is an unusual diagnosis and affects & lt ; 0.01 % of the general population and 2.5 % of the hypertensive population . it is the second most common type of visceral artery aneurysm and constitutes 15 – 25 % of all such cases . 2 – 4 they are mostly located in the main renal artery usually at its bifurcation . typical age at presentation is between 40 and 60 years with no gender predilection . atherosclerosis and fibrous dysplasia are the two most common underlying aetiologies , but raa can be present in patients with angiomyolipoma , congenital renal malformations , a history of trauma or renal surgery , malignancy or systemic infection . our patient was a 26 - year - old pregnant woman with no such history .  haemodynamic changes during pregnancy , that is increased blood volume and cardiac output , raised intra-abdominal pressure and hormonal alterations , affect the arterial wall and increase the risk of rupture of raa , more so in the third trimester . our patient had third pregnancy which may have increased the risk of development and rupture of the aneurysm . the patients are asymptomatic till the aneurysm ruptures and presents with severe flank or abdominal pain with or without haematuria . owing to the pregnant state , such presentation can be misdiagnosed as placental abruption or uterine rupture casearean section planned for , with the final diagnosis made only at exploration . our patient had flank pain with gross haematuria without any haemodynamic instability and ultrasonography revealed a left raa , avoiding misdiagnosis .  treatment is recommended for all aneurysm & gt ; 2cm in size or & gt ; 1cm aneurysm in child bearing age group , or if there is progressive enlargement , arterior venous fistula , uncontrolled hypertension or hemorrhage . rupture of raa is a life - threatening condition with mortality rates as high as 20 % . the outcomes are poorer in pregnant patients with 38 % maternal and 74 % fetal mortality . although successful management by endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms with delivery of a healthy baby by elective caesarean section has been described in the literature , raas are mostly treated surgically with either nephrectomy or renal salvage with in situ or ex situ aneurysmal repair . endovascular interventions are reserved for ruptures in post-partum period . our patient already had 2 live children and was in second trimester of pregnancy . she was given options for surgery and endovascular treatment with associated risk to fetus . she opted for the less invasive endovascular approach with a subsequent need for medical termination of pregnancy .  traditionally , endovascular aneurysmal repair requires insertion of coils , cyanoacrylate or gelfoam . coil embolisation is excellent for narrow neck aneurysm or small calibre vessels where multiple coils can be deployed to block the feeder vessel . however , in the current case , the aneurysm was arising from the main renal artery and there was a high chance of coil migration . to completely occlude inflow into the main renal artery , we used an amplatzer vascular type ii plug . this is a flexible , self - expanding , nitinol - based cylindrical device with a wide array of applications . as compared to coils , it resists migration ; thus , it can be accurately placed and causes immediate and complete embolisation . complete interruption of blood flow into the aneurysm was documented immediately after deployment and this was confirmed the next day and 1 month later .  patient 's perspective  i was afraid of open surgery and the associated high risk , so i opted for this procedure and it has worked well for me . there was minimal pain , quick recovery and it avoided a large scar on my left side . it is just that i have to be on regular follow - up for some time .\",\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': \"summary  with the introduction of potent immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic medications for various diseases , there is an increased incidence of therapy - related myeloid neoplasms . they are the result of mutational rearrangement and historically , have a grave prognosis compared with de novo myeloid neoplasms . we did a short review on various types of myeloid leukaemias reported after therapy with antitumour necrosis factor and also report , to the best of our knowledge , one among the very few cases of therapy - related acute promyelocytic leukaemia in a patient on infliximab therapy for refractory crohn 's disease . the patient responded well to the traditional treatment and is in complete remission for more than 5 years .  background  it is a very rare and possibly one of the few case reports of acute promyelocytic leukaemia ( apl ; acute myeloid leukaemia m3 , aml - m3 ) to be reported in a patient with refractory crohn 's disease on maintenance infliximab therapy .  case presentation  3a 42 - year - old woman with a long - standing history of crohn 's disease had been followed up in the haematology clinic for anaemia . she was diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia due to chronic diarrhoea and was treated with intravenous iron therapy intermittently . in addition to iron therapy , she was treated with vitamin b12 , folic acid and blood transfusions occasionally . her previous therapy for crohn 's disease included steroids , sulfasalazine , 6 - mercaptopurine and azathioprine . failure to achieve optimal symptom control prompted treatment with infliximab . she was started on standard intravenous induction regimen of 5 mg / kg at 0 , 2 and 6 weeks . she responded well to the treatment and was kept on maintenance infusions of infliximab ( 5 mg / kg every 8 weeks ) for approximately 24 months . with intravenous iron supplement , her anaemia improved . her white cell count ( wcc ) and platelets were normal . she remained in stable condition for more than 2 years . however , gradually , over a period of few months , it became noticeable that she developed leucopenia and worsening anaemia . her complete blood count showed wcc 1700 / mm3 and haemoglobin 7.6 g / dl . her platelet count remained normal . these abnormalities prompted a bone marrow biopsy . flow cytometry analysis of the bone marrow aspirate revealed 15 % blasts / immature cells positive for cd117 , cd13 and cd33 blasts , but negative for cd34 and hla - dr . the immunophenotypical findings were highly suspicious for apl ( aml - m3 ) . two - colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( fish ) was performed on interphase nuclei using probes for the pml gene on chromosome 15 and the rara gene on chromosome 17 . juxtaposed signals were present in 10 % of the cells , consistent with apl ( aml - m3 ) . the bone marrow aspirate smear showed myeloid cells with irregular nuclear contours , indented and bilobed and granular cytoplasm ; some with auer rods were seen ( figures 1 and 2 ) . bone marrow biopsy showed 80 – 90 % cellularity with sheets of immature myeloid cells , morphologically compatible with atypical promyelocytes and represented more than 30 % of total cellularity . myeloid maturation was markedly decreased . residual erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes were present . routine cytogenetic analysis revealed normal female karyotype . the patient was subsequently admitted to the hospital and received induction therapy with idarubicin and all - trans - retinoic acid ( atra ) with careful monitoring of the coagulation profile and fibrinogen due to the risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation . she tolerated the induction treatment without major complications . repeat bone marrow aspiration and biopsy after blood count recovery revealed less than 2 % blasts . the bone marrow was normocellular with a cellularity of 55 – 60 % . all three cell lines were present with good maturation . flow cytometry was negative . fish and pcr studies for t ( 15 , 17 ) pml / rar - α were negative confirming complete molecular remission . she received consolidation treatment with idarubicin and atra for two cycles .  outcome and follow - up  the patient remains in remission for more than 5 years . she still follows - up in the haematology clinic for her chronic anaemia and receives intravenous iron treatment and vitamin b12 injection monthly .  discussion  therapy - related myeloid neoplasms ( t - mn ) is a relatively new phrase that has been coined by the who to include a series of malignant haematological diseases previously described as therapy - related aml . chemotherapeutic agents that have been linked to the development of t - mn include alkylating agents and topoisomerase ii inhibitors . other causes of aml include ionising radiation and benzene exposure . many of the distinct clinical and cytogenetic subtypes of t - mn are the result of preceding cytotoxic treatment . the latency period between cytotoxic therapy and development of t - mn ranges from a couple of months to many years , depending on the dose , duration and kind of preceding cytotoxic therapy . alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and melphalan have a latency period of 5 – 7 years and are associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities such as loss of part or all of chromosomes 5 and / or 7. the karyotypes are often complex . t - mns caused by topoisomerase - ii inhibitors such as anthracyclines , mitoxantrone and etoposide typically result in translocations involving the mll gene on chromosome 11 , band q23 and less commonly , the aml1 gene on chromosome 21 , band q22 . in contrast to alkylating agent - associated t - mn , these leukaemias have a much shorter latency of 1 – 3 years and are not associated with preceding mds .  the incidence of aml related to non-cytotoxic agents is very rare . there have been a few reports in the literature that have described the development of aml with the use of tumour necrosis factor ( tnf ) - α inhibitors . agents that have been reported include etanercept , adalimumab and infliximab . infliximab is a chimeric igg 1 monoclonal antibody consisting of human and murine sequences , which have a high affinity towards tnf - α . with the presentation of an antigen , there is an unrestrained response of helper lymphocytes type 1 ( th1 ) in crohn 's disease because of defective regulation that stimulates the inflammatory response . researchers have shown that the role of infliximab is not limited the blocking of tnf activity but also has other vital functions such as , involvment in the modulation of tnf - producing cells by complement fixation , antibody - dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis of t lymphocytes and monocytes , 3 and the down - regulation of other proinflammatory cytokines .  infliximab has been effectively used in various inflammatory conditions such as crohn 's disease , ankylosing spondylitis , ulcerative colitis , rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis . infliximab is being extensively used in all types of crohn 's disease including refractory luminal , steroid dependent and refractory fistulising crohn 's disease . multiple adverse events have been reported in postmarketing trials such as malignancy , injection site reactions , infusion reactions , demyelinating diseases , heart failure , induction of autoimmunity and serious infections . 4 although the risk of these adverse effects is very low , it is important for clinicians to be aware of these side effects . brown et al reported the incidence of eight cases of lymphoma in patients on infliximab from may 1999 to december 2000 . lymphomas are the most common malignancies reported with the use of infliximab and other anti-tnf - α therapy . 5 a cohort study of 50 000 patients with inflammatory bowel disease carried out in sweden suggests an increased risk of haematopoietic cancers especially lymphomas , but no trends towards higher risks for myeloid leukaemia were observed in crohn 's disease . 6 a meta - analysis carried out by pedersen et al7 confirmed this observation that there is marginally increased risk of leukaemias with ulcerative colitis , but no such inclination is established with crohn 's disease .  a search of the english literature was carried out through pubmed and google scholar using the words ‘ acute myeloid leukemia after anti-tnf inhibitors ’ , ‘ apl ’ , ‘ tnf alpha inhibitors ’ , ‘ leukaemia and inflammatory bowel disease ’ and ‘ myeloid leukemias and autoimmune disorders ’ . the search was focused on articles , reviews and case reports published between years 1980 and 2013 . the detailed review of the literature revealed six reported cases of aml after therapy with tnf - α inhibitors ( table 1 ) . there was only one reported case of aml - m5 after 5 months of infliximab therapy in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis ( table 1 ) . our patient was diagnosed with apl ( aml - m3 ) after 2 years of infliximab treatment for crohn 's disease .  clinical characteristics of reported cases of acute leukaemia after infliximab therapy  prior exposure and time duration raised concern that infliximab could be associated with the development of apl ( aml - m3 ) in this young patient . however , other underlying circumstances might also influence disease development . our patient could have an increased risk for leukaemia due to the presence of an autoimmune disorder . anderson et al8 analysed the association of myeloid malignancies with autoimmune disorders and found that autoimmune disease is associated with a significant increase in the risk of aml with an or of 1.29 ( 95 % ci 1.2 to 1.39 ) . other authors have compared the incidence of myeloid leukaemia in patients on immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune disorders and concluded that it is very difficult to ascertain the link between myeloid leukaemia and immunosuppressive drugs , due to the increased risk of developing leukaemia in the setting of autoimmune disease compared with the general population . all the patients mentioned in table 1 were initially treated with immunomodulators such as thioprines , before they were started on biologics , so the causal association between the thioprines and leukaemias can not be ruled out and needs to be further established .  conclusion  the patient presented here developed apl ( aml m3 ) after a long exposure to infliximab , raising the concern that infliximab may be involved in leukaemia development . the presence of an autoimmune disease such as crohn 's disease may also potentiate leukaemia . it is difficult to define a single aetiology for therapy - related aml because there are multiple host and environmental factors , which can influence the development of leukaemia . however , caution should be drawn from this case and other published case reports that tnf - α inhibitors can be associated with increased risk of aml and lymphomas . patients should be evaluated promptly if they develop blood count or other haematological abnormalities when they are treated with tnf - α inhibitors .\",\n",

a nasogastric tube and urethral catheter were inserted . preoperatively , mechanical bowel preparation was done .  the patient was placed in right lateral position . pneumoperitoneum was achieved by the closed method . we employed three ports . the first port was a 10 mm camera port inserted lateral to the left rectus above the umbilicus . two ports were employed for hand instruments , on the left was a 5 mm port just below the costal margin in the line of left nipple and on the right was a 10 mm port in the anterior axillary line at the level of umbilicus . the descending colon was mobilised and lienorenal ligament divided . the adrenal gland was mobilised on all sides , except laterally , with the help of harmonic scalpel . the adrenal vein was ligated by clips and divided . after lateral mobilisation and detaching adrenal from kidney , the gland was delivered by a 5 cm incision by extending the 10 mm working port ( figure 3 ) . the specimen measured 11 × 8 cm and weighed 405 g ( figures 4 and 5 ) . the operating time was 200 min and total blood loss was 60 – 70 ml , no blood transfusion was needed .  outcome and follow - up  postoperatively per urethral catheter was removed and patient ambulated on the morning after surgery . orally liquids were started on the same day . analgesia was needed only for first two postoperative days and the day of surgery . within 48 h both hypertension and blood sugar levels stabilised without the need for any medicines . the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day .  histopathology showed pheochromocytoma of left adrenal gland without capsular involvement ( figure 6 ) . in the 1 year follow - up after surgery the patient continues to remain normotensive and euglycemic .  discussion  a thorough preoperative work - up is key for differentiating the various cases of hypertension and adequate preoperative treatment is paramount when indicated .  laparoscopy has become the gold standard for performing adrenalectomy . 2 for unilateral tumours , a transperitoneal lateral approach is the most preferred because greater workspace is available secondary to gravity assisted retraction of the bowel . adrenalectomy by open approach usually requires large incisions which may have to be extended into the thorax particularly for large size tumours . in this case , the adrenal tumour was of very large dimensions ( 11 × 8 cm ) . laparoscopic adrenalectomy becomes progressively more difficult with the increasing size of the adrenal tumour and is particularly difficult for adrenal masses more than 8 cm . laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal pheochromocytomas is difficult because tumours are larger and more complications are seen related to their hormonal secretions , in spite of adequate pharmacologic blockade . 5 we were able to successfully accomplish the procedure in 200 min which is comparable to the time taken by the open approach . the blood loss was significantly less ( 60 – 70 ml ) , the vessels can be reliably secured with medium - large titanium clips . since the entire procedure was carried out laparoscopically , the postoperative recovery was very smooth enabling early ambulation and restoration of oral feeds culminating in an early discharge ( third day ) . thus the laparoscopic adrenalectomy for tumours as large as 10 cm can be accomplished in a reasonable time frame with minimal blood loss reducing the analgesia requirement and hospital stay . 37 , – , 9 the blood pressure fluctuations during laparoscopic adrenalectomy are lesser due to minimal handling of tumour . 10  the same tumour if dealt with by an open approach would have certainly necessitated a thoracoabdominal incision and greater blood loss . apart from respiratory complications this would have lead to prolonged paralytic ileus and delayed ambulation with its concomitant complications and a postoperative hospital stay of 10 – 14 days . the large incision carries the potential of infection and chances of herniation in later life .  previously a tumour size exceeding 5 – 6 cm was thought to be a contraindication for laparoscopic approach . 11 several studies state a tumour size greater than 8 – 10 cm or preoperative suspicion of malignancy as contraindications for laparoscopic approach . 12 , – , 14  but several recent studies have shown that laparoscopic approach is technically feasible , safe and comparable with open approach patients with large adrenal masses . 15 , – , 17',\n",

( b ) high - power view ( × 40 ) of the patient 's biopsy specimen on h & amp ; e stain showing masson bodies and fibromyxoid cells ( black arrow ) .  diagnosis  a diagnosis of copd with cop was made . the diagnosis of copd was based on ( a ) a 40 - pack - year history of smoking , ( b ) obstructive ventilatory defect on spirometry , ( c ) paraseptal emphysema and left lower lobe bullae visible on hrct . the diagnosis of cop was supported by ( a ) ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern on hrct , ( b ) left - sided pleural effusion , ( c ) mild restriction along with a severe diffusion defect , ( d ) histopathology suggestive of op and ( e ) absence of a definite aetiology for op .  treatment  the patient was initiated on tablet prednisolone 0.5 mg / kg body weight daily for 15 days followed by an alternate day regimen for 2 months . simultaneously , treatment for copd in the form of an inhaled long - acting β - 2 agonist and muscarinic antagonist was started .  outcome and follow - up  within a fortnight , the patient experienced marked clinical improvement with symptoms being largely resolved . chest imaging performed 2 months later ( figures 4a , b ) showed remarkable radiological clearance . the patient subsequently went back to his native place and was lost to follow - up .  ( a ) chest x-ray performed 2 months later showing resolution of the left upper and middle zone consolidation . ( b ) high - resolution ct of the thorax ( lung window ) performed 2 months later showing marked clearing of the lesion .  discussion  cop is an uncommon clinical entity that is generally seen in the sixth decade ; it presents without any specific constellation of symptoms . 2 the condition is more commonly observed in never - smokers and ex-smokers , and occurs twice as frequently in this group as compared with that of smokers . although there is no gender predisposition , it occurs more frequently in females who are non-smokers . most series on cop have shown an inverse relationship with smoking . 4 , 12 – 14 however , an italian study detected cop in 54 % patients who were current smokers as compared with 32 % never - smokers and 14 % ex-smokers . 15 our patient too was a current smoker .  chest x-ray is inevitably the first diagnostic clue for raising the suspicion of op / cop . five major radiological series5 , 16 – 19 have highlighted three characteristic radiological patterns with multiple areas of patchy consolidation — often migratory — being the most common presentations . these areas of consolidation correspond to the granulation tissue plugs within the alveoli . on hrct scan , these appear as areas of ggos or consolidation with air bronchograms in a bilateral and subpleural distribution . the next common radiological pattern is that of a solitary nodule or mass - like area of consolidation ( focal op / cop ) — often localised in the upper lobes — which can cavitate . non-resolving consolidation is not uncommon and not infrequently mimics a malignant lesion , as positron emission tomography scan can falsely be positive . patients with focal op / cop are often subjected to invasive diagnostic procedures to exclude lung cancer , which may result in a diagnosis of op / cop . the third pattern described in op / cop is infiltrative or progressive fibrotic op / cop , characterised by a combination of interstitial and alveolar opacities , mostly seen in lower lung fields . this pattern is usually a pulmonary manifestation of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy , which may precede the muscular symptoms . in these patients , autoantibodies , especially antisynthetase antibodies , should be assayed . apart from these three particular radiological descriptions , other imaging findings include bronchial wall thickening , centrilobular nodules , pleural effusion and ‘ atoll ’ sign . the ‘ atoll sign ’ , also known as ‘ reverse halo ’ sign , has been recorded in up to 20 % of patients and was once considered as a specific radiological sign in op / cop . 21 this sign has now been reported in tuberculosis , infectious pneumonia , paracoccidioidomycosis , invasive aspergillosis , granulomatosis with polyangiitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis . 22 pleural effusion has been reported in up to 22 % of patients with op23 and is more common in secondary op as compared with cop . 24 our patient too had a left - sided pleural effusion .  the ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern is an unusual hrct finding and a search of pubmed and other databases revealed four patients with op9 – 11 who presented with this characteristic radiological image ( table 1 ) . in addition , there is mention of one patient in a series describing a ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern but details were not available . 25 this distinctive pattern was first described in a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and is still considered as a diagnostic hallmark of the disease . 26 however , this has now been documented in several other diseases . 27 on hrct , the ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern is seen as areas of ggos superimposed with interlobular septal thickening and intralobular lines in a geographic distribution resembling irregularly laid cobblestones . these areas of air - space opacification are usually bilateral and sharply demarcated from the surrounding normal lung parenchyma . this unusual pattern is thought to occur due to alveolar filling processes , interstitial fibrotic processes or a combination of both . 28 one of the differential diagnosis of the ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern can be a ‘ swiss - cheese ’ appearance . this pattern occurs when pneumonia develops in pulmonary emphysema . the parenchymal consolidation appears to be non-uniformly ‘ perforated ’ , resembling multiple cavities . this is due to low attenuation areas forming a ‘ swiss - cheese ’ appearance , which could be mistaken for honeycombing .  summary of the four documented patients with organising pneumonia / cryptogenic organising pneumonia presenting as a ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern  all four patients diagnosed with op and a ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern were females in the age group ranging from 24 to 56 years . 9 – 11 in three of four patients , both lungs had the same appearance9 – 11 while only one had a unilateral ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern affecting the right upper lobe . our patient was a male with a unilateral ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern involving the left upper lobe . in three of four patients , the diagnosis was established with biopsies9 , 11 while one had a clinical diagnosis . 10 none of the patients had a diagnosis of cop . in a review of five radiological series documenting 153 patients with op / cop , a ‘ crazy - paving ’ pattern was not reported in any patient . 5 , 16 – 19  although open lung biopsy is still considered the gold standard for diagnosis , in practice , transbronchial biopsy is often of help . histopathologically , there is presence of buds of granulation tissue ( masson bodies ) consisting of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts embedded in connective tissue .  lung function tests in cop show a mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory pattern with an impaired diffusion capacity . however , patients with a history of smoking and underlying copd may have an obstructive ventilatory defect , 2 as was seen in our patient .  corticosteroids form the standard therapy for cop , with doses of prednisolone ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg / kg / day and tapered over 6 months . this often results in marked improvement , as was seen in our patient . immunosuppressive agents may be used as an adjunct to steroids in case of persistent disease . relapses are known to occur in cop and are seen in 13 – 58 % of patients on decreasing the dose or stopping of corticosteroids . however , in patients with relapse , response to corticosteroids is dramatic .  op / cop is a rare but distinct clinical entity with well - defined imaging findings . however , a crazy - paving ’ pattern as a presentation of cop is rather exceptional .\",\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': \"summary  congenital lobar emphysema ( cle ) , a rare condition that usually presents in the neonatal period , can be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the treating clinician . if unrecognised , it is a significant risk at the time of anaesthetic induction . we describe a case of cle in a 3 - month - old boy who was initially treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia at the referring hospital . we highlight the importance of careful consideration of common childhood respiratory illness as well as pneumothorax in the differential diagnosis , and the significance of appropriate preoperative anaesthetic management . we also emphasise the importance of acknowledging a mother 's concerns when taking a paediatric history .  background  congenital lobar emphysema ( cle ) is a rare disease with a varied presentation . the main considerations in managing these children are : the need to make an accurate diagnosis in order to exclude more commonly encountered childhood respiratory diseases ; to distinguish cle from pneumothorax ; and to avoid positive pressure at induction of anaesthesia . children with cle face a significant anaesthetic risk and require expertise in treatment .  case presentation  a 3 - month - old boy was admitted to the referring hospital after a choking episode of postbottle - feed at home .  during the choking episode , he went floppy and blue for ∼ 15 s . otherwise , he had been well , and was afebrile . on presentation to the referring hospital , he was tachypnoeic with associated increased work while breathing . he was treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics and nasal prong oxygen for 1 week . although he improved clinically , there was ongoing concern regarding his tachypnoea and persistent abnormal chest radiograph findings . chest x-ray on presentation to our institution is presented in figure 1. of note is the fact that the boy 's mother had reported on a number of occasions to her local medical officer her son 's ‘ fast breathing ’ around 5 – 6 weeks of age .  right middle zone hyperlucency , right upper and lower zone collapse , and associated mediastinal shift to the left .  the boy was born at term , via normal vaginal delivery , weighing 3900 g ( 85th centile ) . no resuscitation was required at birth , and admission to the neonatal unit was not required . no abnormalities were detected antenatally . there was no significant family history .  the boy was transferred to our facility late in the evening and admitted via the emergency department . on arrival , heart rate was 152 , respiratory rate was 65 – 70 , and oxygen saturations 99 % in room air . he was afebrile . weight was 5100 g ( 3rd centile ) which represented a significant fall from his birth percentile . venous blood gas composition was : ph 7.36 , pco2 55 mm hg , po2 45 mm hg , hco3 30.3 mmol / l , base excess 3.7 mmol / l . he was started on high flow humidified oxygen in the emergency department for increased work of breathing . a ct chest scan was scheduled for the following day . he remained clinically stable in the paediatric ward overnight , and examination the next day revealed a thin , bright , alert , smiling infant . respiratory rate was 50 – 55 on 4 l / min of humidified oxygen . oxygen saturations were 99 % . there was an increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest wall , reduced air entry in the right mid-to - lower zones , and widespread expiratory wheezes . there were mild - to - moderate subcostal / intercostal recessions and tracheal tug . although the heart sounds were normal , the apex beat was displaced laterally . heart rate was 140 .  he underwent inhalational anaesthetic induction with sevoflurane and lignocaine 10 mg airway topicalisation maintaining airway pressures at & lt ; 10 cm h2o . during the ct , ventilatory support was maintained on the dräger primus anaesthetic machine circuit with a pressure support setting of 12 cm h2o above a positive end - expiratory pressure of 4 cm h2o , and a brief breath hold during inspiration with airway pressures below 20 cm h2o . ct findings are displayed in figure 2. the patient was extubated after the ct and taken to the postanaesthetic care unit , with the plan of elective surgery on the next day as the ct scan took place late in the evening . however , the patient ’ s work of breathing increased in the postanaesthetic care unit ; after surgical review of the images and the patient , a decision was made to proceed to emergency lobectomy . the patient was then taken to the operating theatre and emergency thoracotomy took place with the patient again undergoing inhalational induction with sevoflurane supplemented with ketamine in 0.2 mg / kg boluses up to 0.6 mg / kg , fentanyl 0.5 µg / kg , and local anaesthetic infiltration . delivery of the emphysematous lobe is displayed in figure 3. pressure support ventilation was continued until delivery of the lobe , at which time positive pressure ventilation was instituted . the patient remained intubated in the paediatric intensive care unit until the following morning .  significant hyperexpansion and hyperlucency of the right middle lobe with contralateral shift of mediastinal structures . the right upper and lower lobes are compressed by the overinflated right middle lobe resulting in collapse .  the resected lung lobe was received fresh in the pathology laboratory in a hyperinflated state . the lobe was perfused with formalin for optimal fixation , and large amounts of froth were observed to flow from the bronchi . unlike most lung specimens , no further expansion of lung occurred during formalin perfusion , compatible with initial hyperinflation . histopathological examination showed overdistention of normally formed alveoli , in the pattern of lobar hyperinflation ( figure 4 ) . unlike emphysema in adults , there was no tissue destruction of alveolar walls . there were no features of aspiration pneumonia , infection , proximal bronchial stenosis / obstruction or proximal cartilage abnormality . a definitive cause for the emphysematous lobe was not found .  outcome and follow - up  discussion  cle is a rare anomaly of the lower respiratory tract that is characterised by hyperinflation of one or more pulmonary lobes . unilateral involvement of the left upper and right middle lobes is usual , although bilateral cases have been reported . 1 – 5 for unknown reasons males are affected more commonly than females .  lower airway obstruction , either intrinsic or extrinsic , leads to the creation of a ‘ ball - valve ’ mechanism in which a greater volume of air enters the affected lobe during inspiration than leaves it during expiration , producing air trapping . bronchial cartilage dysplasia or deﬁciency leading to bronchomalacia is the commonest cause ; however , as in our patient , a definitive cause is not found in up to 50 % of cases . extraluminal compression from bronchogenic cysts , vascular anomalies , and tumours also occur . endobronchial causes of lobar emphysema are also well recognised , including mucus plugs , granulomas , polyps , mucosal folds , bronchial stenosis and foreign bodies .  the presentation of cle is variable from an acute neonatal respiratory emergency to recurrent respiratory embarrassment or chest infection in the older child . antenatal diagnosis is possible with ultrasonography ; however , babies with prenatally diagnosed cases are not always symptomatic at birth . usually the earlier the presentation , the more severe the symptoms . 2 the main diagnostic dilemma arises when attempting to distinguish cle from more commonly encountered childhood respiratory disease such as pneumonia . pneumonia is a common misdiagnosis for cle and although it would be unlikely to result in inappropriate chest tube insertion , it is an important consideration nonetheless .  clinical diagnosis can be challenging and chest radiograph is often diagnostic . key findings include : hyperlucency on the affected side with ipsilateral atelectasis , widened rib spaces and diaphragmatic flattening . the mediastinum may be displaced away from the affected side and may herniate into the contralateral hemithorax . 1 – 3 as has been previously reported in other cases , it is essential not to misdiagnose a pneumothorax because inappropriate chest drain insertion can have potentially disastrous consequences . 1 – 3 the primary distinguishing feature of cle is the extension of bronchovascular markings into the radiolucent area .  ct chest is the usual adjunct to chest radiograph in confirming the diagnosis . ct scan can accurately delineate the anatomy of the affected lobe as well as identify other potential aetiological factors such as vascular anomalies and tumours . mri is an alternative modality , but is not routinely used . radionuclide ventilation - perfusion scans show diminished ventilation and loss of perfusion in the affected lobe . the technique also establishes whether the lobe affected by cle is non-functional , and whether the compressed lung is functioning normally . 1 – 3  the role of bronchoscopy is controversial . although useful in cases of suspected foreign body or other endobronchial causes of cle , bronchoscopy may in fact aggravate the respiratory distress in patients with cle and is not usually required for the diagnosis .  the mainstay of treatment in patients with serious symptoms is lobectomy ; however , anaesthetic considerations are paramount to a positive surgical outcome . the greatest risk is if excessive positive pressure ventilation is applied before opening the chest . this may cause rapid inflation of the emphysematous lobe and subsequent cardiopulmonary compromise . there is no means of judging the critical airway pressure at which dangerous overinflation may occur . spontaneous ventilation , gentle assisted manual ventilation or titrated pressure - support ventilation settings are all feasible . 6 it is suggested that airway pressures be maintained at & lt ; 20 – 25 cm h2o . 7 – 9 however , prolonged preoperative ventilation has been described , 10 as has utilisation of high frequency ventilation with minimal airway pressures . 11  the other technique to avoid overinflation of the diseased lung segment is lung isolation to prevent further ventilation of the emphysematous area . this may be achieved by endobronchial intubation ; placement of an endobronchial blocker , which is usually positioned extraluminally to the endotracheal tube ; or even with a modified double - lumen tube for paediatric patients . 6 , 12 – 15 it is essential to have a surgeon ready to perform an immediate thoracotomy , if required .  techniques to facilitate thoracotomy in the absence of muscle relaxation include use of regional analgesic approaches , or use of local anaesthesia and a mixed analgesia plan with ketamine and opioids . maintenance of spontaneous ventilation , usually with inhalational agents , is most commonly described , but this may also be supported by adjunctive ketamine and judicious use of opioids . once the emphysematous lobe has been delivered through the thoracotomy site it is unlikely there will be any issues with standard positive pressure ventilation . although in this case the patient remained intubated and ventilated overnight , there is often no immediate impediment to immediate extubation . conservative management is reserved for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases .  the use of video - assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy for other types of congenital lung malformations has been reported in the literature . this surgical approach is difficult in patients with cle because the pleural cavity is mostly occupied by the affected lobe which usually remains inflated . lobectomy via thoracotomy is the usual surgical approach . 18  we earlier stated the importance of appreciating a mother 's concern given that there had been several encounters with the local medical officer with reports of ‘ fast breathing ’ prior to the patient 's acute presentation . furthermore , the patient ’ s weight gain during this period was inadequate , which should have also raised concerns . an earlier chest radiograph could have prevented the need for an afterhours emergency operation and allowed for planning of an elective procedure .  to conclude , cle is a rare disease with a varied presentation and is often misdiagnosed . lobectomy is the mainstay of treatment in symptomatic cases , although conservative management is reasonable in infants and older children who have no or minimal symptoms . prognosis after lobectomy is usually excellent . children with cle face a significant anaesthetic risk and require treatment expertise .\",\n",

e x400 ) .  outcome and follow - up  after the initial excision biopsy , the patient subsequently underwent mohs micrographic surgery for margin control and right upper lid reconstruction , achieving a good cosmetic result . there has been no recurrence at the latest review , 11 months postoperatively .  discussion  the coexistence of two different tumours in the same lesion , known as a collision tumour , is an unusual entity which has been well documented for a variety of benign and malignant lesions . however , there have been few reports of collision tumours involving the eyelid . 3 , – , 7 a large retrospective review of approximately 40 000 cutaneous biopsies found only 69 collision tumours , of which only four involved the eyelid . to the best of our knowledge there are no previous reports of hidrocystoma colliding with bcc in the literature .  eyelid hidrocystomas are relatively common lesions which are among the top five benign eyelid lesions encountered in ophthalmic practice , accounting for 8 % of benign eyelid lesions . 1 these sweat gland tumours are either of eccrine or apocrine sweat gland origin and are usually easy to diagnose ; presenting as solitary or multiple small , tense , dome - shaped , thin walled - cysts which are slow growing , but can reach a maximum diameter of 15 mm . they are usually translucent , skin - coloured lesions but are occasionally lightly or deeply pigmented . 9 because they are slow - growing and are usually asymptomatic , they are generally regarded as an insignificant cosmetic blemish and are unlikely to be referred for treatment , especially under new commissioning rules . however , not infrequently , malignant pathology may be misdiagnosed as a hidrocystoma ; this is especially true of cystic bcc . similarly , a cutaneous malignant melanoma may be mistakenly diagnosed as a pigmented hidrocystoma . induration , loss of lashes , a pearly appearance or pigmentation should raise suspicion of malignancy and warrant histological examination . dermoscopy may also help to differentiate between benign and malignant pathology but the clinical differentiation between the two can be difficult even after histopathological examination . 2 a study of 5504 eyelid skin tumours revealed a poor correlation between clinical and histological diagnosis for several tumour subtypes . 1 this concurs with our clinical experience and suggests that both general clinicians and ophthalmologists should exercise caution in using clinical diagnosis alone in making the diagnosis of eyelid lesions .  various treatment options have been tried for hidrocystoma including simple needle puncture , surgical excision , electrodessication of the cyst wall , carbon dioxide vaporisation , pulsed - dye laser treatment and intralesional injection of trichloroacetic acid ( tca ) . because lesions that appear to be hidrocystomas could be malignant or coexist with malignant pathology , we recommend very careful examination of these lesions to exclude signs of malignancy and a low threshold for complete surgical excision and histological examination where suspicion exists . interestingly , the bcc component of this tumour could have been missed by a more superficial biopsy , such as , decapitation , or other treatment modalities such as needle puncture or intralesional tca .  this case highlights the fact that hidrocystoma may be difficult to differentiate from malignant pathology on clinical appearance alone , and is a reminder that benign and malignant pathology can coexist within the same lesion , albeit rarely .',\n",

year - old woman was referred to our cardiology clinic with increasing chest pain , dyspnoea and palpitations on a background of known fabry disease . manifestations of her fabry disease included acroparaesthesia , proteinuria and cardiomyopathy . she also had a background history of psoriasis and psoriatic arthropathy . she had been identified as a mutation carrier shortly after her son was diagnosed in 1994 .  a skin biopsyhad been performed in 1994 with dna analysis of α galactosidase gene in fibroblasts . single - strand conformation polymorphism analysis showed a mutated sequence in exon 2 of the gene , showing point mutation - causing glycine substitution for aspartate ( d93g ) .  neither of her parents showed the same mutation and so it was presumed to be de novo . she had had proteinuria since 2004 with mildly elevated plasma and urinary globotriaosylceramide ( gb3 ) levels at this time .  renal biopsy in 2005 had shown accumulation of sphingolipid and she was , at the time , initiated on fabrazyme treatment . she was switched to replagal in 2006 due to issues with procurement of fabrazyme , which she currently takes fortnightly as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.2 mg / kg .  her medications at the time consisted of : methotrexate 15 mg weekly , folic acid 5 mg once daily , atorvastatin 10 mg once daily , replagal infusion 0.2 mg / kg intravenous fortnightly .  she was referred to our cardiology service from the national centre for inherited metabolic disorders for an opinion on her overall cardiac status , in december 2014 .  her main symptom at that time was chronic exertional central chest pain . she described a central , stabbing ‘ knife ’ sensation associated with shortness of breath . these episodes lasted approximately 1 min and often radiated to her jaw or left arm .  she also described palpitations , occurring mainly at night and , on very rare occasions , dizzy episodes . she did not describe any orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea .  cardiovascular examination was unremarkable .  on auscultation of the precordium , heart sounds 1 and 2 were present , there were no added sounds or murmurs and the apex beat was not displaced . the jugular venous pulse was not elevated and there were no signs of pedal oedema . respiratory examination was also normal with no bibasal crepitations and normal vesicular breath sounds .  in 2005 , she had had a presumptive diagnosis of fabry cardiomyopathy based on the echocardiographic appearances of anterolateral lvh with reduced left ventricle cavity size without evidence of obstruction .  she underwent a full cardiology work -

elevated c reactive protein and blood cultures grew streptococcus acidominimus . transthoracic echocardiography displayed vegetation on the mitral valve and a left atrial myxoma . she was treated with intravenous benzylpenicillin and erythromycin for the infective endocarditis ( ie ) and remains well 3 months post-treatment . s. acidominimus is considered a common veterinary pathogen rarely found in humans . to the best of our knowledge , only two prior reports of ie due to this organism exist in the literature . this case highlights how rare pathogens can cause unusual presentation and the importance of ie as a differential even in the absence of classical signs , if fever and new murmur are present .  background  infective endocarditis ( ie ) is associated with a high rate of mortality ( approximately 30 % ) and morbidity , despite advances in diagnosis and treatment . 1 in recent years , reports in the literature reveal a widening pool of causative microorganisms and a variation in clinical presentation of ie than that classically described . nonetheless , staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci still remain the most common causative agents . we report a case of a 77 - year - old woman with left atrial myxoma and livedo reticularis who was diagnosed with streptococcus acidominimus endocarditis . to the best of our knowledge , only two prior reports of ie due to this organism in humans exist in the literature .  case presentation  a 77 - year - old woman presented to the emergency department with a 1 - week history of anorexia , fatigue and general malaise . she also had a 3 - day history of fever . she did not have any associated symptoms of cough , chest pain , headache , abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits or lower urinary tract symptoms . she had a background of hypertension , hypothyroidism and mild dementia . the patient lived in a residential home and did not smoke or abuse alcohol .  physical examination revealed bilateral mottled discolouration on the anterior aspect of her knees ( figure 1 ) . on admission , the patient was tachycardic ( heart rate : 165 bpm ) , hypotensive ( blood pressure : 89 / 50 mm hg ) , tachypnoeic ( respiratory rate : 28 breaths / min ) and febrile ( temperature : 38.5 ° c ) , with oxygen saturation of 94 % on air . cardiac auscultation revealed a grade 2 / 6 pansystolic murmur loudest at the apex . the remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable .  investigations  laboratory evaluation revealed a raised white cell count of 15.7 × 109 / l ( reference range : 3.8 – 11 × 109 / l ) with 95 % neutrophils , haemoglobin of 127 g / l ( reference range : 115 – 155 g / l ) and platelets at 306 × 109 / l ( reference range : 150 – 400 × 109 / l ) . c reactive protein was raised at 73 ( reference range : 0 – 5 mg / l ) . apart from mildly elevated urea and creatinine , other laboratory parameters were within the normal range . autoantibody screen was negative . urinalysis was unremarkable . ecg showed sinus tachycardia without pr prolongation . chest radiograph was also unremarkable . blood cultures grew s. acidominimus sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin . transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) was performed , which incidentally revealed longitudinally dilated left atrium with a large round echogenic partially mobile structure measuring 2.8 × 3.2 cm attached to the interatrial septum ( figures 2 and 3 ; video 1 ) . tte also showed vegetation on the mitral valve ( figure 3 ; video 1 ) .  differential diagnosis  treatment  following initial resuscitation , the patient was managed with intravenous benzylpenicillin ( 1.2 g every 4 h ) and erythromycin ( 12.5 mg / kg every 6 h ) . cardiac surgery was offered . however , a shared decision - making process between the patient , family members and the multidisciplinary team led to a decision against surgery for the atrial myxoma in view of patient and family wishes , her comorbidities and frailty .  outcome and follow - up  the patient remained in hospital for 6 weeks to receive the intravenous antibiotic therapy . she made a good recovery from the infection and the livedo reticularis disappeared . she was subsequently discharged and remains well 3 months after treatment .  discussion  s. acidominimus , a member of the viridans group streptococci , is considered a common pathogen in veterinary medicine and is rarely found in humans . s. acidominimus was first isolated from bovine sources in 1922 by ayers and mudge . it is a normal inhabitant of bovine skin , vagina and raw milk . limited cases causing infections of wounds , cysts , external abscess , pericarditis , pneumonia , meningitis and urethral infection have been reported in humans . to date , only two cases of s. acidominimus endocarditis have been reported in the literature , 2 , 3 thus the clinical and epidemiological significance of this pathogen remain uncertain . the diagnosis of ie is based on the duke criteria comprising clinical signs , positive blood cultures and presence of vegetation on echocardiography , the imaging of choice . our patient had positive blood cultures and the presence of vegetation on tte ( figure 3 ; video 1 ) . classical signs of ie such as splinter haemorrhages , janeway lesions , osler 's nodes or roth spots have been noted to occur less frequently in ie2 , 5 and were also absent in our patient . the variety of clinical presentations of ie could be related to an increase in unusual causative microorganisms . it has been suggested in the literature that classical peripheral signs of ie may not be evident in ie caused by unusual microorganisms . interestingly , our patient presented with asymmetrical livedo reticularis across the anterior aspect of both knees ( figure 1 ) . this cutaneous manifestation may represent peripheral emboli from the vegetation , an association that has previously been reported in the literature . although , in rare cases , atrial myxoma is also thought to be associated with livedo reticularis . both variations in the microbiological cause , especially unusual organisms , and subsequently clinical presentation of ie , demand appropriate diagnostic screening . in view of increasing antibiotic resistance , initiation of new treatment regimens with broader antimicrobial coverage may initially become necessary to incorporate uncommon organisms . treatment regimens would then require modification tailored to the susceptibility patterns of rare microorganisms . we started our patient on intravenous benzylpenicillin ( 1.2 g every 4 h ) and erythromycin ( 12.5 mg / kg every 6 h ) due to bacterial sensitivity to these agents .  our case occurred in a 77 - year - old woman without the classical peripheral manifestations and was caused by an unusual microorganism . this highlights the need for a high index of suspicion of ie in febrile patients with a new murmur , livedo reticularis or atrial myxoma .\",\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': 'summary  chronic paroxysmal hemicrania ( cph ) is a rare primary headache syndrome , which is classified along with cluster headache and short - lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing ( sunct ) as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia . cph is exquisitely responsive to indomethacin , so much so that the response is one of the current diagnostic criteria . the case of a patient with cph , who had marked epigastric symptoms with indomethacin treatment and responded well to topiramate 150 mg daily , is reported . cessation of topiramate caused return of episodes , and the response has persisted for 2 years . topiramate may be a treatment option in cph .  background  chronic paroxysmal hemicrania ( cph ) is a rare primary headache syndrome , which is classified along with cluster headache and short - lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing ( sunct ) as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia . 1 the international headache society classification criteria2 require relatively brief ( 2 – 30 min ) episodes of severe unilateral orbital , supraorbital or temporal pain accompanied by cranial autonomic symptoms . the episodes are prevented completely by therapeutic doses of indomethacin . the main troublesome side effect of indomethacin is gastric irritation in about 25 % of patients , 4 which has necessitated the withdrawal of indomethacin in cph , and the use of alternatives , such as cyclo - oxygenase 2 inhibitors , rofecoxib , valdecoxib and celecoxib , 5 – 7 and calcium channel blockers .  we report the case of a patient with cph with a good response to indomethacin , which had to be withdrawn because of gastric side effects , who had a subsequent good and prolonged response to topiramate .  case presentation  a 42 - year - old man sustained an injury to the left side of the face in 2001 ; the next day , he started experiencing episodes of severe pain in the left temple , lasting 2 – 30 min ( average duration 15 min ) . they were accompanied by ipsilateral conjunctival injection , lacrimation , nasal blockage and eyelid oedema . there was no nausea , vomiting , photophobia , phonophobia or osmophobia . he would experience 15 – 20 episodes / day , which sometimes clustered during the day , but could wake him from sleep . movement would not make the pain worse , although he tended to keep still during an episode . there were no aura symptoms .  he had never had similar headache problems . he had experienced some milder headaches in the past , which were throbbing , beginning in the neck and radiating to the frontal region , with pain being aggravated by movement and lasting for some hours . he experienced no other symptoms .  his family history showed that his father , who was now deceased , had experienced migraines . no other medical problems were observed . he did not smoke and drank no alcohol . cranial nerve examination was normal , as was the rest of the neurological examination . mri of the brain was normal .  he received indomethacin 50 mg 3 times daily , which reduced the length of his episodes to 30 – 120 s , the frequency to 8 – 10 times a day and the severity from 8 / 10 to 5 / 10 on an oral rating scale . high flow oxygen ( 12 litres / min ) took the edge off the pain . intranasal lidocaine and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg were not beneficial . a single dose of intramuscular indomethacin 100 mg abolished his episodes for several hours . the patient ’ s clinical picture and response to indomethacin is consistent with a diagnosis of cph based on the international classification of headache disorders .  he was discharged from hospital on indomethacin 50 mg twice daily and ranitidine . after 6 weeks , he developed epigastric pains and was switched to a proton pump inhibitor . he was prescribed celecoxib instead of the indomethacin , at doses up to 400 mg daily , with inconsistent , sometimes useful , effects on his headaches .  he was then prescribed topiramate at an increasing dose starting at 25 mg daily . at doses from 200 to 350 mg daily he had almost complete abolition of his episodes , but noticed side effects of cognitive slowing , dry mouth and weight loss . at a lower dose of 100 mg daily there was a moderate effect , with 3 – 4 episodes / day of 5 – 10 min duration . thereafter , an intermediate dose of 150 mg daily was achieved , with only 1 – 2 episodes / day . at 2 years follow - up , he still has good control of his episodes . when he reduces the dose , the episodes return .  treatment  outcome and follow - up  discussion  this patient has post traumatic cph , which has been described previously . indomethacin effected a good response , but had to be stopped because of the gastric side effects . in his case , cyclo - oxygenase 2 inhibitors had no effect , although they have been reported to be effective in other cases of cph5 – 7 and hemicrania continua . 10 however , the recent findings that chronic high dose cyclo - oxygenase 2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease and heart failure , 11 and the lack of response of some patients to cyclo - oxygenase 2 inhibitors , necessitate that a suitable alternative preventive measure be identified . it is our experience that verapamil is not often helpful in patients with paroxysmal hemicrania in contrast with cluster headache .  topiramate is a neuromodulator that is effective in the prevention of migraine , as shown in placebo - controlled trials , 12 – 14 and in open label trials in cluster headache15 – 18 and sunct , 19 – 22 although a robust response has not been seen in all open label trials . 23 – 25 there is a case report of the effectiveness of topiramate in paroxysmal hemicrania - tic syndrome . 26  topiramate is also used in the treatment of other painful conditions , including painful diabetic neuropathy . 27 it has been reported to be as useful in intercostal neuralgia , 28 and in a case series of trigeminal neuralgia , 29 but not in a placebo - controlled study . topiramate has multiple mechanisms of action . 31 they include modulating voltage - gated sodium ion channels , blocking excitatory glutamate receptors , modulating voltage - gated calcium ion channels , inhibiting carbonic anyhdrase and enhancement of inhibitory γ - aminobutyric acid - mediated chloride influx through γ - aminobutyric acid a receptors . inhibition of trigeminovascular nociceptive traffic is seen with topiramate in experimental animals , 33 and this action seems to occur outside the trigeminocervical complex . 34 the known side effects of topiramate include somnolence , paraesthaesia , diminished appetite , nausea , diarrhoea , weight loss , abdominal pain and dysgeusia . 35 central nervous system adverse events included somnolence , insomnia , memory difficulty , language problems , concentration difficulty , mood problems and anxiety . 35 additionally , renal calculi and paraesthaesia occur rarely , 31 attributed to weak carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate . it is suggested that starting at low doses , once or twice daily , and making small increments thereafter can minimise side effects ; such was the case in a group of patients with cluster headache . 15 it is noted in our patient that the side effects were present only at higher doses ( & gt ; 200 mg / day ) , and he came to a suitable compromise on an intermediate dose at which there were no adverse effects , but his cph episodes were adequately suppressed . accepting the limitations of no placebo treatment , the recrudescence of the episodes with cessation of treatment , the prolonged effect and natural history of cph each argue for a real therapeutic effect in this case .  given the success of topiramate in other primary headache and pain syndromes , this report of a beneficial effect of topiramate in paroxysmal hemicrania in our patient highlights its usefulness in trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias , especially in cases where indomethacin and other preventive treatments are not viable .',\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': 'summary  a 60 - year - old woman presented after a fall and was noted to have ascites . she had a history of ulcerative colitis . history and physical examination did not reveal the likely aetiology of the ascites , but a sample showed it to be a blood - stained exudate . a malignant cause appeared likely , cross-sectional imaging was arranged and tumour markers sent . ca125 was 34 iu / ml ( 0 – 30 ) ; α - fetoprotein ( afp ) and carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) were normal . however , ca19 - 9 was 2880 u / ml ( 0 – 31 ) . pancreatic carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma were of prime concern , but a ct scan and mri imaging were normal . at laparoscopy a benign ruptured ovarian cyst was detected , and ascites drained . ca19 - 9 returned to normal and the patient remains well 9 months later . this case demonstrates how tumour markers may be misleading in the context of diagnostics , and is the highest reported example of ca19 - 9 rise in the context of benign ascites and benign ovarian pathology .  background  discerning the cause of ascites can be a challenging clinical problem . tumour markers are often used in clinical practice when malignancy is considered a likely cause . we want to alert primary care practitioners , doctors , oncologists , gastroenterologists and gynaecologists to this case that demonstrates the need to use tumour markers appropriately to avoid unnecessary tests and anxiety , and highlights an unusually high ca19 - 9 level resulting from a ruptured benign ovarian cyst .  case presentation  a 60 - year - old woman was referred to our department from her doctor with ascites of unknown aetiology . she had presented 4 days previously after a fall that had caused facial bruising , but no other obvious injury . her past medical history included bullous pemphigoid , hypertension , depression and ulcerative colitis , which had been quiescent for 30 years . her medications were lisinopril 10 mg , citalopram 20 mg , furosemide 20 mg , prednisolone 5 mg , minocycline mr 100 mg daily and alendronate 70 mg / week .  she was a housewife , living with her husband , and she drank no alcohol . she had stopped smoking 20 years ago . physical examination revealed a well woman with facial bruising , withdrawn affect and a distended abdomen due to ascites , with peau d ’ orange but no organomegaly . there were no other clinical signs of chronic liver disease or heart failure .  investigations  her white blood cell ( wbc ) count was 12.6 ( normal differential ) , platelets 456 , with normal haemoglobin and clotting . urea and electrolytes , liver function tests , calcium and lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) were all normal . her c - reactive protein was 100 mg / litre . urine dipstick demonstrated no protein but was positive to leukocytes and nitrites and later grew escherichia coli on culture .  the ascites was tapped , was visibly blood - stained , and showed total protein of 80 g / litre , albumin of 54 g / litre ( serum albumin 41 g / litre ) , a normal amylase and ldh . ascites microscopy and gram stain revealed no organisms , a wbc count of 5526 / μl ( polymorphs 5440 / μl ) and red blood cell count of 28 160 / μl . there was no growth on standard culture , or on stain and culture for mycobacteria . in the presence of a blood - stained exudate , and concern over malignancy , cross-sectional imaging was performed and tumour markers were sent . ca125 was 34 iu / ml ( normal range 0 – 30 ) , α - fetoprotein ( afp ) , carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) and ca15 - 3 were all normal ; however ca19 - 9 was 2880 u / ml ( normal range 0 – 31 ) .  a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal .  a ct scan of the abdomen with contrast demonstrated large volume ascites but normal intra-abdominal organs and peritoneum , and no cause for the ascites found . the ca19 - 9 had raised particular concerns of an occult pancreatic malignancy or cholangiocarcinoma , the latter perhaps in concert with undiagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis ( ulcerative colitis ( uc ) associated ) . mri of the pancreas and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( mrcp ) were normal however . although an initial pelvic ultrasound had reportedly shown normal ovaries , a transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated a left ovarian mass . at laparoscopy a macroscopically benign ruptured ovarian cyst was detected and biopsied ; 6 litres of ascites was drained fully .  histology of the cyst confirmed it was benign , showing an attenuated degenerate epithelium ( fig 1a ) . as expected , ca125 weakly stained this epithelium ( fig 1b ) , as did cea ( fig 1c , arrows to brown stain ) , showing the cyst to be most likely a mucinous cystadenoma . ca19 - 9 also stained the attenuated epithelial cells focally present and the basement membrane diffusely ( fig 1d , arrow to brown - stained epithelium ; arrowhead to basement membrane ) , an unusual finding in ovarian cysts , confirming it as the most likely source of serum ca19 - 9 . pancreatic carcinomas can metastasise to the ovary , but the detailed mr imaging had already excluded this possibility .  differential diagnosis  outcome and follow - up  discussion  the serum carbohydrate antigen ca19 - 9 , a sialylated lewis blood group antigen , was first described by its monoclonal antibody by koproswki in 1981 . 1 the recommended use for ca19 - 9 is as follow - up and prognosis for a confirmed pancreatic carcinoma , or to aid diagnosis of a pancreatic mass or biliary stricture . in suspected pancreatic cancer mass ca19 - 9 has a sensitivity and specificity of around 70 % and 80 % , respectively . 2 about 10 % of the general population is — by inheritance — negative for this lewis blood group antigen and , thus , will not express ca19 - 9 if they develop pancreatic carcinoma .  isolated low - level elevation of ca19 - 9 has been described in benign ovarian dermoid cysts ( teratomas ) in three case reports , 3 – 5 and also reported in up to 50 % of teratomas with malignant change , 3 but our case is the highest reported rise associated with benign ovarian pathology ( the previous being 1430 u / ml ) . the immunohistochemistry we performed on this cyst suggested it as the source of ca19 - 9 . it is possible however that , at least in part , the detectable serum ca19 - 9 was due to the resultant contact of cyst fluid with the peritoneum , and / or the presence of an inflammatory ascites .  there are no reported cases of elevated ca19 - 9 of this magnitude in benign ascites . two previous studies6 , 7 have assessed tumour markers in the diagnosis of ascites aetiology . chen et al6 compared 123 patients with either malignancy - related ascites or benign ascites , and found statistically significant differences in serum ca19 - 9 levels between the groups . using a cut - off level of 50 u / ml , ca19 - 9 had a sensitivity and specificity of 65.5 % and 93.6 % , respectively ; their conclusion being that it is not sensitive enough , or cost effective , as a diagnostic marker . sari et al7 performed a similar study of 76 patients and came to the same conclusion . neither study reported median ca19 - 9 levels in benign ascites above 100.9 u / ml .  although serum tumour markers ( tm ) in general are often measured in hospitalised patients , their use is often unjustified either in clinical or economic terms . arioli et al8 showed that 62 % of hospital inpatients had a tumour marker requested , 79 % as part of a diagnostic work - up , and only 5 % following existing published evidence . loi et al9 showed that the most popular use of tm is for screening . they looked at 476 patients who had tm requested , and showed it to be helpful in only 29 % of patient management ; it aided diagnosis in only 4 patients .  in summary this case demonstrates that ca19 - 9 levels as high as 3000 u / ml can be due to benign intra-abdominal disease , and it highlights the problems caused by the use of tumour markers outside of the available evidence base .',\n",

year - old hypertensive woman following the intake of a combination of tranexamic acid and mefanamic acid .  case presentation  a 41 - year - old female patient , a known hypertensive for the last 6 years on a combination of amlodipine 5 mg + atenolol 50 mg once daily presented to casualty with retrosternal squeezing type of chest pain with radiation to left arm and associated with sweating . she reported to our casualty 4 h and 15 min after the onset of chest pain .  she had a history of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea for the past 3 years . she was evaluated for the same and found to have a fibroid in her uterus . she was put on a combination of tranexamic acid 500 mg and mefenamic acid 250 mg three times a day . she had been taking this for the last 2 years , every 5 days from the onset of every menstrual period . the last time she had consumed the drug was 14 days prior to the onset of chest pain .  there was no other significant history .  she was a mother of two children and her last child birth was 13 years back . her antenatal and postnatal periods were uneventful . she had no history of miscarriages  she was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic , and had no history of any recreational drug use .  her mother , father and four siblings had no significant history . at admission , on examination her pulse rate was 64 / min regular , bp was 170 / 90 mm hg and her jugular venous pressure was not elevated . she was pale . her cardiovascular examination was normal except for an lv s4 . her general examination and other systemic examinations were within normal limits .  the resting 12 - lead ecg showed st elevation mi ( inferior wall + right ventricle mi ) . her echo revealed a dilated left ventricular ( lv ) ( 5.42 / 3 . 15 cm ) with concentric lv hypertrophy and good lv systolic function ( ejection fraction 63.9 % ) , regional wall motion abnormality right coronary artery ( rca ) territory , stage 1 diastolic dysfunction .  she was taken for primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) and the coronary angiography , which showed a discrete eccentric 99 % lesion of proximal rca with thrombus with thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction ( timi ) 1 flow distally . thrombus aspiration was performed with a thrombuster ii device and the lesion was stented with 4 × 15 prolink ( bms ) . timi iii flow attained ( door to balloon time was 45 min ) ( figures 1 ⇓ ⇓ – 4 ) investigations  investigations showed haemoglobin : 9.4 g / dl , total count : 7290 , differential count : n 65 % , l 33 % , e 2 % , platelet count 340 000 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate : 13 m / h , bt 1 min 30 s , ct -

up  discussion  the risk factors for the mi in this 41 - year - old premenopausal woman were systemic hypertension , dyslipidaemia ( newly detected ) and possibly the intake of the combination of antifibrinolytic agent ( tranexamic acid ) and nsaids .  it has recently been reviewed by the british medical journal and was believed to be useful in saving lives after heavy bleeding . it was thought to be useful in the crash 2 trial . 2 so the journal was questioning why no one used it . this article specifically describes the risk of mi being between 0.43 and 1.09 , the relative risk was 0.68 , ( p 0.11 ) that is favourable for the drug . it was believed to reduce the need for blood transfusions . again they have related the relative risk of deep vein thrombosis as − 0.86 ( 0.53 – 1.39 ) ( p 0.54 ) , and the relative risk of pulmonary embolism was 0.61 ( 0.25 – 1 . 47 p 0.27 ) . but the relative risk for stroke was high and not beneficial . it was 1.14 ( 0.65 – 2 p + 0.65 ) . we comment that none of these values show protection from these side effects , hence it is possible that the drug does cause excess thrombosis . 2 , 3  sirker et al4 described a young woman who developed acute inferior wall mi after tranexamic acid . she also had another bleeding disorder with easy bruising . she had a successful caesarean section on ddavp and tranexamic acid earlier . after a shoulder joint surgery she developed acute mi . the authors commented that in a low - risk situation , which was probably because of tranexamic acid .  this drug is especially harmful in women taking hormonal contraceptives .  though tranexamic acid causes clotting when bleeding occurs , it does reduce the mortality . in a large trial crash 2 , the relative risk of death in heavily bleeding patients was 14 % in the tranexamic acid group versus 16 % in the placebo group ( all cause mortality reduction because of less bleeding ) ( p 0.0035 ) .  despite this it is possible that this drug causes coronary thrombosis in susceptible patients . possibly , along with hypertension this drug might have contributed to acute mi in this patient .  tranexamic acid is especially to be avoided in obese women and those who smoke as they can develop arterial or venous thrombosis . our patient was obese . further it should be avoided in patient using the following : all - trans retinoic acid , factor ix concentrates and hormonal contraceptives . occular side - effects and retinal artery occlusion have also been described . caution should be used when prescribing this drug to renal or hepatic failure patients .  possible conclusions on tranexamic acid use will come after the results of the atacas trial , a randomised trial of aspirin and tranexamic acid in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting . the recruitment of subjects is still going on .',\n",
