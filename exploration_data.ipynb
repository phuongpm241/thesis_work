known entity__END , which may BEG__mimic caput succedaneum__END ( moulding of the presenting part in the birth canal during natural delivery ) , and to provide a historical and embryological background .\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nBEG__Amniotic band disruption syndrome__END is a rare entity which occurs in 1 in 1200 to 1 in 15 000 live births .\\n1 It may cause a BEG__myriad of deformities of fetal body parts__END from BEG__mild defects in limbs to severe craniofacial defects__END incompatible with life .\\nThe BEG__spectrum of defects__END includes BEG__disruption__END , BEG__deformation__END and BEG__malformation__END of different body parts due to interference from the BEG__amniotic bands at different stages of organogenesis__END .\\n2 The BEG__syndrome__END is also described as ADAM complex ( for ‘ BEG__amniotic deformities__END , BEG__adhesions__END , mutilation ’ ) or BEG__amniotic band disruption complex__END ( ABDC ) for its nature of presentation .\\nSince BEG__Tropin__END described the condition in 1968 , 3 many questions regarding this BEG__syndrome__END remain unanswered because of its rarity and complex mechanism .\\nThis case is unique in its presentation as it BEG__mimics caput succedaneum__END without any BEG__neurological defect__END .\\nThis type of presentation has not been described before in the medical literature .\\n\\nCase presentation\\n\\nA girl , born at 38 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery of normal duration of labour , presented with a BEG__large caput over the left parietal region__END ( figure 1A , B ) .\\nThe mother was a 32 - year - old primigravida without any BEG__significant medical illness__END .\\nThere was no family history of BEG__consanguinity__END or BEG__chronic illness__END .\\nThe pregnancy was uneventful and BEG__antenatal scans__END were reported as normal .\\nThe mother had a history of BEG__premature rupture__END of the membrane of more than 24 h and had BEG__prophylactic antibiotics__END .\\nThe baby did not cry immediately after birth .\\nThe BEG__Apgar score__END at 1 min was 5 , and this increased to 9 after five inflation breaths .\\nHer BEG__blood sugar__END was 6.1 mmol / litre .\\nHer BEG__birth weight__END was 1960 g ( 9th to 25th centile ) and BEG__head circumference__END was 29 cm ( 9th centile ) .\\nShe was pink , handling well and moving all her limbs spontaneously .\\nHer BEG__oxygen saturation__END on air was 99 % .\\nShe did not have any BEG__respiratory distress__END , BEG__visible congenital anomaly__END or BEG__audible cardiac murmur__END .\\nThere was no BEG__frontal bossing__END , BEG__ear abnormality__END or BEG__hypertelorism__END .\\nBEG__Musculoskeletal and neurological examination of the baby__END was normal .\\nThe craniofacial contours of the parents were unremarkable .\\n\\nThe BEG__circumference of the asymmetric swelling of the scalp__END was 26 cm .\\nA BEG__clear wide demarcation line__END was present between the BEG__swelling__END and the vessels of the scalp .\\nThe skin over the BEG__swelling__END appeared darker than the rest of the scalp .\\nBEG__Cranial sutures__END including the BEG__saggital suture__END could not be felt due to the BEG__swelling__END .\\nThe newborn was given BEG__nasogastric feeding__END and BEG__intravenous cefotaxime__END .\\n\\nInvestigations\\n\\nHer BEG__blood investigations__END were all within normal limits .\\nA BEG__skull x-ray__END showed BEG__moulding of the skull bone over the left parietotemporal region__END ( figures 2 and 3 ) .\\nNo BEG__overriding or fracture__END was found except BEG__soft tissue swelling__END overlying the vertex .\\nAn BEG__ultrasound scan of the brain__END showed symmetrical lateral ventricles in both hemispheres with falx at the midline .\\nA BEG__collection of fluid__END of 0.7 – 1 cm in diameter was found over the calvaria , which was suggestive of BEG__caput succedaneum__END .\\n\\nA BEG__subsequent MRI__END showed the left hemicranium was distorted with BEG__relative preservation on the right side__END ( figure 4 ) .\\nThere was some BEG__concavity of the right parietal bone__END at the edge of BEG__caput succedaneum__END and BEG__similar inbowing of the lateral cranium on the left side__END , which was suggestive of modelling by an BEG__amniotic band__END .\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis\\n\\nBEG__Treatment__END\\n\\nOutcome and follow - up\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThough the exact aetiology of ABDC is unknown , two main pathogenetic mechanisms are proposed .\\nExogenous theory suggests BEG__early amnion rupture__END leading to a BEG__fibrous band__END that can entrap fetal body part ( figure 5 ) .\\nThe endogenous theory suggests BEG__vascular__END compromise .\\nGenetic factors might operate in some cases .\\n\\nMoerman et al described three types of BEG__lesions__END in this complex : ( A ) BEG__constrictive tissue bands__END ( BEG__shrivelled amniotic strands ) , ( B ) amniotic adhesions__END ( fusion between disrupted body part and intact amniotic membrane ) and ( C ) limb – body wall complex .\\n6 According to their observations , most of the BEG__craniofacial defects__END occur as a result of a BEG__vascular disruption sequence__END with or without BEG__cephaloamniotic adhesions__END , unlike the case described here that had the clear mark of a constriction band without BEG__significant vascular compromise__END .\\n\\nAn accurate diagnosis may be achieved by looking for the major features of BEG__amniotic band syndrome__END , and a BEG__routine chromosome study__END and BEG__placental examination__END in cases with BEG__multiple congenital anomalies__END .\\n27\\n\\nThough encephalocele , clefts , BEG__distortion__END and BEG__dislocation of craniofacial structures__END have been described as presentations of BEG__craniofacial defect__END related to this BEG__syndrome__END in the medical literature , 5 BEG__distorted hemicranium__END ( BEG__mimicking caput succedaneum__END ) without any BEG__neurological defect__END has never been described previously .\\nThe outcome of the BEG__syndrome__END depends on the gravity of BEG__malformation__END .\\nTermination of pregnancy is considered in cases of severe craniofacial or BEG__visceral abnormality__END .\\nSuccessful limb salvage by fetoscopic release of an BEG__amniotic band__END has been reported .\\nMost of the BEG__minor craniofacial defects__END require BEG__multiple surgical procedures__END to restore function , with BEG__significant compromise to satisfactory cosmesis__END .',\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': \"summary  pregnancy with liver cirrhosis is a rare and dangerous event that exposes mother and fetus to potentially lethal risks . during pregnancy , hepatic decompensation could suffice and the development of hepatic failure and encephalopathy could occur . the incidence of obstetric complications is also increased with a high rate of pre-eclampsia , postpartum bleeding , preterm delivery and stillbirth . we report a case of a 27 - year - old woman with autoimmune hepatitis and liver cirrhosis complicated by splenomegaly , oesophageal varices and severe thrombocytopaenia . during pregnancy , close clinical and analytical surveillance was performed . she was medicated with corticosteroids , azathioprine and propranolol . at the 25th week of gestation , an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to control oesophageal varices . this patient had an uneventful pregnancy until 37 weeks . at 37th week of gestation , after spontaneous rupture of membranes , signs of acute fetal distress were observed , and an urgent caesarean was performed . good neonatal and maternal outcomes were achieved .  background  autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) is a rare liver disease , diagnosed in women of childbearing age , 1 , 2 that could lead to liver cirrhosis . however , a good therapeutic response is usually achieved resulting in a more benign clinical course . reports regarding pregnancy exist from as early as the 1970s . early published series reported unfavourable outcomes with a high incidence of obstetric complications4 : fetal loss , severe pre-eclampsia , prematurity , fetal growth restriction , high rate of caesarean delivery and aih flares , which could lead to hepatic failure and death . the maternal and fetal outcomes recently reported are much more favourable , secondary to better clinical management of this disorder . 4 , 7 – 10 the risks associated with pregnancy with chronic liver diseases are increased when cirrhosis and portal hypertension are present . 11 rupture of oesophageal varices is the most fearful event in pregnant women with cirrhosis , representing the leading cause of death in these patients . these patients usually also need medical treatment with immune modulating drugs , such as azathioprine , the safety profile of which , during pregnancy , is not yet fully defined . 14  we report a case of an aih patient with severe liver disease , complicated by cirrhosis and portal hypertension . this case highlights the importance of expert obstetrical care , including regular medical assessments , during and after pregnancy .  case presentation  we report a case of a 27 - year - old woman with aih diagnosed during her infancy . diagnosis had been performed based on clinical presentation , elevated serum transaminases , hypergammaglobulinaemia , circulating autoantibodies ( positive antinuclear antibodies ) , presence of chronic active hepatitis on as an liver biopsy ( it was described interface hepatitis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates , piecemeal necrosis and lobular necroinflammatory activity ) and response to immunosuppressive therapy ; and absence of viral markers for hepatitis b and c , history of exposure to hepatic toxics or markers of genetic liver disorders . the patient fulfilled the criteria for a definitive aih diagnosis according to the european association for the study of the liver . 15 her medical history was noteworthy forhistologically confirmed cirrhosis of 5 - year duration ( figures 1 – 3 ) , complicated by portal hypertension with evidence of oesophageal and rectal varices , splenomegaly and severe thrombocytopaenia . an episode of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred 4 years before pregnancy — it was controlled using local endoscopic treatment . the patient was a primipara , with menarche at the age of 14 years . she also had a history of oligomenorrhoea .  fibrous septa ( coloured in blue ) involving regenerative hepatic parenchymal nodules , observed in cirrhotic stage of hepatic disease ( masson 's trichrome , × 100 ) .  her pregnancy had not been planned , so the first obstetric appointment occurred at the 7th week of pregnancy . she had no signs of liver decompensation at the initial physical examination . she was medicated with propranolol ( 40 mg three times a day ) , azathioprine ( 100 mg / day ) , ranitidine ( 300 mg / day ) and prednisolone ( 5 mg / day ) . the risks related to a pregnancy with aih complicated with cirrhosis , portal hypertension and severe thrombocytopaenia were explained to her . she decided to keep the pregnancy , continuing all chronic medication , including azathioprine . folic acid supplementation was added .  initial laboratory tests were : aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) 26 iu / l ( reference value ( rv ) : 10 – 30 iu / l ) , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) 13 iu / l ( rv : 10 – 36 iu / l ) , c - glutamyl - transferase 31 iu / l ( rv : 6 – 39 iu / l ) , total bilirubin 1.65 mg / dl ( rv : 0.20 – 1.00 mg / dl ) , direct bilirubin 0.41 mg / dl ( rv : 0 – 0.20 mg / dl ) , haemoglobin 12.3 g / dl ( rv : 12 – 15 g / dl ) , thrombocytopaenia 35 000 / µl ( rv : 150 000 – 400 000 / µl ) , prolonged prothrombin time ( pt ) 13.2 s ( rv : 11.3 s ) and positive antinuclear antibodies .  obstetric surveillance with regular liver function evaluation was performed ( figure 4 ) . during the third trimester , periodic fetal evaluation showed that the fetus was growing accordingly to what was expected , and the amniotic fluid and umbilical artery doppler indexes were always in the normal range for gestational age .  throughout the pregnancy , transaminases remained within normal range , and total bilirubin and direct bilirubin remained slightly elevated , within the usual patient values . severe thrombocytopaenia does not exacerbate during pregnancy . an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy ( ogd ) was performed at 25 weeks of gestation to evaluate the oesophageal varices . it revealed hypertensive gastropathy with a marbled pattern in the gastric body , and fundus and a small varicose vein in the lower 1 / 3 of the oesophagus , but without indication for local treatment . these findings were similar to the previous ogd performed before the patient 's pregnancy ( figures 5 and 6 ) .  at 37 weeks of gestation , she was electively admitted to prepare for delivery . after a spontaneous rupture of membranes , fetal monitoring showed signs of distress ( spontaneous severe repetitive decelerations ) . an urgent caesarean section was performed under general anaesthesia . before the delivery , the patient 's platelet count was 33 000 / l , so a platelet transfusion ( 2 units ) was performed preoperatively , to minimise the risk of haemorrhage . a healthy newborn was born , weighing 2550 g , with an apgar score of 7 at the first and 8 at the fifth minute . the cause of the abnormal non-stress test was a tight cervical cord . tube ligation was performed as per the patient 's wishes . the placental histological evaluation was accordant with the gestational age , without pathological signs .  the postpartum developed without complications , with ast , alt and other hepatic function tests within normal range even 6 weeks after birth . to reduce the probability of a postpartum flare , prednisolone dosage was increased to 10 mg / day during the first month of puerperium .  discussion  the clinical course of aih during pregnancy is unpredictable , 16 and the ideal management and treatment of pregnant women with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is still unclear . clinical improvement has been reported , however , pregnancy in these patients could be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes . 4 , 7 – 10 disease flares are usually associated with poor control in the year preceding pregnancy and the absence of therapy during gestation . a reduction in the live birth rate has been reported in patients with cirrhosis , 8 with obstetric complications present in nearly half of these cases . 13  gastrointestinal bleeding is the most serious complication in these patients , it occurs in up to 50 % of pregnancies with cirrhosis and portal hypertension . 18 it is more frequent in the second half of gestation and during delivery , because maximum blood volume is achieved and the larger uterus causes elevation of venous pressure due to compression of the inferior vena cava . 12 , 18  all patients with cirrhosis , even without varices before pregnancy , should undergo ogd for assessment of varices in the second trimester . 13 to decrease portal hypertension and to reduce the probability of bleeding , propranolol can be used ( fda category c ) , taking into account the risk of fetal growth restriction . 13  aih activity is often improved during pregnancy , however , most patients require pharmacological treatment to keep clinical stability or to treat flares . 19 corticosteroid therapy and azathioprine remain the mainstay of medical treatment of aih . corticosteroids are considered safe during pregnancy but are associated with an increased incidence of cleft palate when used during the first trimester . 19 azathioprine safety is classically less certain because it has been linked to congenital malformations in animals , and anaemia and myelosuppression . 14 however , the expanding experience of its use in women with other autoimmune disorders and after heterologous transplantation shows that azathioprine is also a safe drug to use during gestation , and probably during breastfeeding as well . 19  the mode of delivery is controversial , however , some authors consider that the rise in abdominal pressure in vaginal delivery using valsalva manoeuvres increases portal hypertension and the risk of bleeding , that is the reason caesarean delivery is recommended . 20  aih is not a contraindication for pregnancy , and satisfactory maternal and neonatal outcomes can be achieved . for this , pregnancy must occur when the aih is silent and medically under control at conception . additionally , the outcome strongly depends on the severity of organ dysfunction at the beginning of pregnancy . to recap , disease control before pregnancy , correct evaluation of organ dysfunction and expert obstetrical care with regular assessment are essential to achieve the best obstetric outcome possible .  pregnancy in patients with underlying cirrhosis represents a major challenge , in which safety and ideal management remain largely unknown .\",\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': 'summary  the present case report assesses the individual performance - related workload in three male children with left ventricular outflow tract ( lvot ) obstruction during alpine skiing . spirometric data ( vo2 ) and heart rate ( hr ) were monitored during alpine skiing in various terrains according to the subject ’ s performance level . a portable spirometric device was used for on - slope data sampling . relative workload was calculated in relation to peak cardiorespiratory values , obtained during an incremental laboratory cycle test . on the slope the subjects reached 78 % to 103 % of their peak ergometric hr and a vo2peak of 65 % to 100 % . young beginners and intermediates with lvot obstruction seem to face a high cardiorespiratory stress during alpine skiing . for the beginner , an additional load is seen during uphill sidestepping with skis . in children suffering from congenital heart disease , physiological aspects of sports activities such as skiing should not be viewed separately from the possibilities of sports participation and social interactions .  background  children with obstruction of left ventricular outflow tract bear a higher risk of sudden ventricular arrhythmia or death due to myocardial ischaemia . by contrast , adapted physical activity provides health benefits such as cardioprotective effects , especially in children with disabilities . furthermore , motor activity in peer groups is a basic necessity for the social development of children who run the risk of being overprotected by parents and isolated from daily activities due to their congenital heart defect .  these physiological and motivational benefits make disease - specific outdoor activity classes increasingly interesting for prevention and rehabilitation in the young . the popularity of skiing , the outdoor scenery and the social environment have made winter sports and alpine skiing classes especially attractive for children with congenital heart disease . 5 however , the in - field cardiorespiratory workload in this target group is not well known .  to objectively assess the pulmonary and circulatory workload in medium risk patients , this study evaluated the relative individual o2 volume ( vo2 ) and heart rate of three boys with left ventricular outflow tract ( lvot ) obstruction during alpine skiing .  case presentation  informed consent by the children and their parents to participate in the study was obtained . testing took place in the austrian kleinwalsertal skiing region near riezlern , located 1150 to 2000 m above sea level . weather conditions comprised partly cloudy skies and temperatures between − 2 and + 4 ° c . the subject ’ s skiing ability was graded by licensed ski instructors , considering years of skiing experience . during the alpine skiing field tests , different slopes and various terrains were used according to individual performance levels .  beginner  the medical history of the beginner ( 11 years old , 49.3 kg , 154 cm , body mass index ( bmi ) 20.7 kg / m2 , age - adjusted p75 , no skiing experience ) features a transposition of the great arteries with subpulmonary stenosis and ventricular septal defect ( taussig – bing anomaly ) and a high - grade preductal aortic coarctation . he underwent surgical resection and end - to - end anastomosis of the coarctation at the age of 3 months . switch operation of the great arteries and closure of the septal defect was performed at the age of 14 months . the gradient over the left ventricular outflow tract was 30 mm hg at rest and rose to 45 mm hg with intravenous application of orciprenalin . systolic left ventricular pressure at this time was 145 mm hg . echocardiography showed no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy .  intermediate  the intermediate skier ( 10 years old , 38.3 kg , 140 cm , bmi 19.5 kg / m2 , age - adjusted p60 , with a total of 2 – 3 weeks of skiing experience ) was born with a bicuspid aortic valve and underwent commisurotomy due to high - grade stenosis ( 110 mm hg ) of the aortic valve at the age of 18 months . at the time of investigation the gradient over lvot was 50 mm hg at rest . the left ventricular myocardium showed no hypertrophy .  advanced  the advanced skier ( 16 years old , 56 kg , 176 cm , bmi 18.1 kg / m2 , 8 kg below p50 , two seasons of skiing experience ) demonstrated with a resting lvot gradient of 33 mm hg and a first - grade insufficiency of the aortic valve . shortening fraction was within normal range ( 38 % ) and electrocardiography ( ecg ) showed sinus rhythm . stress ecg ( treadmill ) at a recent routine check - up before the skiing excursions was stopped due to exhaustion without any signs of ischaemia . there was no surgical or interventional repair of the aortic valve performed until now .  investigations  all subjects performed a laboratory and a field test on the third ( ergometer test ) and fourth ( field ) day of the visit , after altitude acclimatisation .  field test  a portable spirometric device ( oxycon mobile ; jaeger , hoechberg , germany ) was used for on - slope data sampling including breath - by - breath detection of the ventilation and beat - to - beat heart rate via chest belt ( polar , kempele , finland ) . before each test and at least 30 min after the equipment had been turned on , turbine calibration was performed with 0.2 and 2 litre / min of air and gas analysers were calibrated against outside air and standard gas ( 16 % o2 , 5 % co2 ) . an internal altitude adapted recalibration is performed every 10 s .  the measuring units of the oxycon mobile were carried in a small rucksack on the back of the subjects . according to the manufacturer , the device provides accurate results at temperatures between − 10 and + 50 ° c , up to an altitude of 5500 m above sea level and humidity between 10 % and 95 % .  to allocate the different skiing manoeuvres ( downhill skiing , uphill walking with skis , t - bar use ) to the physiological data , synchronous digital video recording was performed and the elevation above sea level was monitored via a polar heart rate monitor ( model s710 , polar , kempele , finland ) during the trial .  laboratory test  to calculate the relative workload , the individual peak cardiorespiratory capacity was measured during an incremental exercise test on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer ( ergo control 500 ; daum electronic , fuerth , germany ) , 1 day before the field test at the same geographical altitude using the identical spirometric device . subjects started with a resistance of about 1 w / kg bodyweight , which was increased by 0.5 w / kg every 3 min until volitional fatigue .  vo2 ( litre / min ) and heart rate ( hr ) ( beats / min ) were collected throughout the exercise test as described above . vo2peak was expressed as the highest 30 - s average value obtained during the test .  outcome and follow - up  subjects completed 3 – 5 steps during the incremental cycle ergometer test . in all subjects , primary and secondary criteria for maximal oxygen uptake ( vo2 plateau , respiratory exchange ratio & gt ; 1.1 ) were not met .  the data of the incremental test as well as peak and mean values of the field test are shown in table 1  peak values and performance data of the laboratory and the field tests according to different movement patterns  beginner  according to the video data of representative skiing sessions , the beginner spent approximately 20 % of the total time skiing , 45 % hiking on skis and 35 % resting while following practical demonstrations and verbal advice given by the instructor .  intermediate  the intermediate had to run a defined slope with an easy second part . after a short walk on skis he used a t - bar to come up to the starting point . after the ski lift he had to walk 40 m uphill to reach the place where the equipment ( mask and chest belt ) was removed .  advanced  the advanced skier had to cope with a challenging slope that can be divided into two steep sections with an easy part in between . peak values were obtained on the second steep and mogul - shaped slope . a chair lift was used for uphill transportation .  discussion  children with congenital heart defects are given a great deal of parental attention . overprotectiveness may lead to social withdrawal and feelings of isolation4 or inferiority , causing a reduction in physical activity and further retraction from peers . however , physical activity can play a decisive role in the psychosocial development since it encourages independence and new experiences , which can alter a child ’ s sense of control and competence . sports participation might also enable the child to better cope with the disease - specific uncertainty . 9  in accordance to the individual performance level of the study participants , the slopes varied from flattened terrain to challenging mogul - shaped runs . although the beginner spent one third of the outdoor recording time resting and listening to the skiing instructor , he experienced profound physical stress during exercises such as uphill hiking , forward pushing by poles and sideway stepping . to some extent , this may also explain the somewhat lower cardiorespiratory output of the intermediate skier .  besides these interpersonal differences , it could be seen from the results on the slope , that vo2peak and hrpeak values reached ( or slightly exceeded ) the corresponding maxima collected during the ergometer test . a few reasons have to be drawn into account for these findings . first , vo2peak and hrpeak are dependent upon the mode of the incremental ergometer test . for example , peak values of vo2 and hr , when attained by cycle ergometry , are lower than the respective parameters collected during treadmill - running . second , the varying muscle contraction patterns ( dynamic vs quasi-isometric contraction ) : the incremental test on the bicycle leads to an anaerobic - lactic exhaustion of the muscles , while peak values during skiing and walking with skis mainly result from short bouts of alactic muscle activity . since the energy metabolism of children is characterised by lower enzyme activity of the anaerobic glycolysis , their ability for long lasting high - intensity muscle activity is reduced , possibly resulting in an underestimation of the cardiorespiratory capacity . since outdoor data was gathered on public ski slopes during regular operation hours , external influences such as overtaking or crossing skiers as well as exposure to cold13 may also have affected physiological responses .  due to the anatomical origin of the coronary arteries beyond the aortic valve , high - grade stenosis of the left ventricular outflow tract can lead to myocardial ischaemia during physical exercise . therefore , health professionals recommend the avoidance of competitive sports that involve high dynamic and static muscular demands , and suggest a medical evaluation including an exercise test before the beginning of cardiovascular training or athletic workout . recommendations from the task force 2 for congenital heart disease15 suggest a graded permission ( dependent on history , stress ecg , exercise tolerance , echocardiographic and catheterisation findings ) , including the allowance for all exercises in the case of a pressure gradient below 30 mm hg ( peak - to - peak systolic gradient , measured via catheterisation ) and a moderate to high limitation of physical activity with a gradient between 30 and 50 mm hg . children with a stenosis with a pressure gradient higher than 50 mm hg ( severe ) should reduce exercises to a low grade leisure activity .  however , from the experience of more than 100 children with congenital heart disease , participating in skiing under supervision of doctors and skiing instructors provides an enjoyable leisure time experience within an environment that allows impaired children to participate and succeed in a range of challenging activities . by noticing improvements in sports activities , self - esteem may renascent and yield to reinforcement of motion - derived self - education . in the same manner , physical exercise with peers represents a valuable basis to improve social competence .',\n",

circumcised lesion in the right adrenal of 3.0 × 2.5 cm suggestive of pheochromocytoma . the patient was started on antihypertensives including α - blockers and β - blockers and planned for right open adrenalectomy . intraoperatively , blood pressure was raised up to 180 / 110 mm hg on slight manipulation of adrenal gland which was controlled with glyceryl - trinitrate and volatile agents . postoperatively urinary vma decreased to normal range and all antihypertensives were gradually stopped . she had uneventful pregnancy and delivered vaginally . this case report highlights the importance of surgical management of pheochromocytoma in second trimester of pregnancy to avoid catastrophic complications later in pregnancy .  background  pheochromocytoma ( pcc ) is a neuroendocrine tumour of the adrenal medulla ( originating in the chromaffin cells ) . pcc is a very rare condition in pregnancy and it carries significant risks to the mother as well as to the fetus . therefore , pcc should be considered as a possible cause of refractory hypertension in pregnancy and appropriate investigations should be carried out . the diagnosis can be established by measuring catecholamines and metanephrines levels in the plasma ( blood ) or through a 24 - hour urine collection for vma . the tumour is generally localised by mri during pregnancy . definitive treatment of pcc is surgical but initially it should be treated medically to control blood pressure with α - adrenergic blockers , followed by β - blockers . in this case report pcc was detected in the second trimester , and managed successfully .  case presentation  a 34 - year pregnant woman was referred to our clinic because of hypertension refractory to medical therapy and right adrenal mass . she had two normal deliveries before this pregnancy and had no complications . she was diagnosed to have essential hypertension when non-pregnant and was prescribed ace inhibitor ( enalapril 10 mg twice daily ) . calcium channel blocker and β - blocker ( amlodipine 10 mg four times a day and atenolol 50 mg twice daily ) were later added by the family physician due to refractory hypertension . meanwhile , the patient became pregnant .  investigations  owing to persistent increased blood pressure ( bp ) she was advised urinary vanillylmandelic acid ( vma ) which was raised 30 mg / 24 h ( normal level 2 – 7 mg / 24 h ) . later the family physician advised ultrasound which revealed an adrenal mass . she had an mri subsequently which confirmed a well - circumscibed lesion in the right adrenal mass of 3.0 × 2.5 cm suggestive of pcc ( figures 1 and 2 ) .  differential diagnosis  hypertension during pregnancy is usually attributable to pre-eclampsia ( pregnancy - induced hypertension ) or chronic hypertension but secondary causes of hypertension should be considered in patients refractory to medical therapy . these include renal vascular hypertension , coarctation of the aorta and adrenal causes of hypertension ( cushing syndrome , conn 's syndrome , pcc ) .  treatment  soon after these diagnostic tests , the patient developed symptoms including sweating , flushing and chest pain with bp 200 / 120 mm hg . cardiac evaluation was performed including ecg and echocardiogram which revealed no abnormality . the treatment was revised and phenoxybenzamine 10 mg thrice daily was initiated resulting in adequate control of hypertension as well as symptoms . obstetric examination and ultrasound of the fetus showed a single alive fetus with normal fetal growth parameters . considering the risk of hypertension during pregnancy and the possibility of aggravation during later stages of pregnancy we decided to excise the mass . surgical risk and risk to fetus was discussed with the patient . obstetrician also agreed with the plan and counselled the patient about the possible chances of miscarriage . the patient was planned for adrenalectomy during 13th week of pregnancy .  the patient was admitted for right open adrenalectomy and started on progesterone pessaries 400 mg twice daily . intraoperatively , bp raised to 180 / 110 mm hg on slight manipulation of adrenal gland which was controlled by the anaesthetist with glyceryl - trinitrate and volatile agents included isoflurane and nitrous to control the bp during surgery . operative time was 160 min with a blood loss of only 200 ml and without any need of transfusion . postoperatively in the recovery room the obstetrician performed ultrasound and the fetal heart was checked , which was found normal .  for pain management the anaesthetist started pethidine via patient - controlled intravenous analgesia ( pcia ) . she was prescribed intravenous paracetamol and morphine after discontinuation of pcia . the patient was kept in the intensive care unit for labile bp for 2 days which was managed by fluid resuscitation and adjustment of dosage of antihypertensives . the endocrinologist gradually tapered off the antihypertensive medication over 3 days postoperatively . on second postoperative day , slight per vaginal spotting was noticed which settled with observation . the patient was discharged on seventh pod with propranolol 10 mg twice daily and progesterone pessaries 400 mg twice daily .  outcome and follow - up  the patient was followed up in the clinic after 2 weeks , she was fine with normal fetal growth parameters on ultrasound . urinary vma decreased to normal range and all antihypertensives were stopped . she was followed up in the obstetric clinic , had safe pregnancy and delivered vaginally at term .  discussion  pcc accounts for 0.1 – 1 % of all cases of hypertension . precise incidence in pregnancy is difficult to determine but more than 200 cases have been reported in the published literature . pcc is a very rare neuroendocrine tumour which originates from the adrenal medulla ( chromaffin cells ) . this tumour is notorious for its devastating consequences . pcc is occasionally referred to as ‘ 10 % tumors ’ because 10 % are bilateral , 10 % are extra-adrenal and 10 % are malignant . in pregnancy , the presence of pcc may be difficult to detect owing to the more prevalent diagnosis of pregnancy - induced hypertension . it is usually suspected when patient is not responding well to antihypertensives . untreated pcc carries a risk of mortality for the mother and the fetus , as high as 58 % . early diagnosis is vital and symptoms and signs vary which includes : hypertension ( 98 % of cases ) , orthostatic hypotension , palpitations , tachycardia , headache , sweating , seizure disorders and anxiety attacks . other symptoms are chest pain , nausea and vomiting , pallor and flushing . pregnancy does not alter urinary catecholamines hence diagnosis is confirmed by 24 h urine vma , metanephrines or catecholamines . metanephrines and catecholamines can be measured in the blood as well . in adults , approximately 80 % of pcc are unilateral and solitary . for localisation ultrasound of the abdomen should be performed as it is easily accessible , cheap and a safe modality in pregnancy and has 89 – 97 % sensitivity . mr has the advantages of greater accuracy , high - quality images and lack of ionising radiation . 9 – 12 as the complication rate increases with progression of pregnancy , late first trimester and second trimester are the ideal times for surgical treatment after organogenesis is completed . surgery should be avoided in early first trimester because of high chances of miscarriage and in late second trimester and third trimester because of abdominal exploration and access is difficult . 12 , 13  pcc should always be treated first medically to stabilise the bp and symptoms . α - adrenoceptor blockade that is either phenoxybenzamine or prazosin and β - blockade is used to control tachycardia and dysrhythmia . the aim of this pretreatment is twofold : first , before undergoing surgery , blood pressure , heart rate and volume depletion should be restored as far as possible . second , the patient should be protected from the toxic cardiovascular effects of preoperative surges of catecholamines . the definitive treatment of pcc is surgical excision either open , laparoscopic or robotic . a brief literature review showed that patients with pcc during pregnancy were managed with one of the two approaches . first , medically up to the end of pregnancy and then tumour excision along with c section . this approach appears to be more suitable for patients who present late in pregnancy and / or adequately manageable with antihypertensives . the second approach is resection of pcc preferably during the second trimester . robotic adrenalectomy during pregnancy has been reported and the patient had no perioperative complication . 13 individualised management is appropriate as no single protocol is suitable for all patients given the rarity and the complexity of the problem .\",\n",

450 ms ) . an outpatient 24 h holter monitor was reported as showing frequent runs of uncontrolled atrial flutter , with rates up to 202 beats / min . the patient was symptomatic , with dyspnoea and palpitations , during these episodes . subsequent ecgs and telemetry as an inpatient showed uncontrolled atrial fibrillation ( af ) or atrial tachyarrhythmia ( fig 3 ) . several electrophysiology specialists reviewed the data and felt af was the predominant arrhythmia present , but other atrial arrhythmias could not be excluded . no persistent organised atrial activity was noted to suggest ongoing atrial flutter . some short bursts of apparently organised atrial activity were occasionally seen , but it rapidly degenerated into an irregularly irregular rhythm suggestive of af . an echocardiogram showed a left ventricular end diastolic dimension of 54 mm ( nr 39 – 53 mm for women ) . the left ventricle appeared mildly hypokinetic for a young woman .  image of three ecgs demonstrating an atrial arrhythmia most likely to be atrial fibrillation .  blood biochemistry revealed na + to be 142 mmol / l , k + 4.3 mmol / l , urea 6.2 mmol / l , and creatinine 61 mmol / l . corrected calcium was 1.40 mmol / l ( nr 2.2 – 2.6 ) and albumin was normal at 40 g / l . magnesium was 0.91 mmol / l ( nr 0.7 – 1.0 ) while organic phosphate was 2.02 mmol / l ( nr 0.8 – 1.4 ) . endocrine assessment showed a parathyroid hormone ( pth ) value of 1.40 pmol / l ( nr 1.6 – 9.3 ) , free thyroxine ( t4 ) of 10.80 mmol / l ( nr 7.5 – 21.1 ) , and thyroid stimulating hormone ( tsh ) of 2.81 mmol / l ( nr 0.34 – 5.6 ) .  a diagnosis of surgical hypoparathyroidism was made . the patient was reviewed by the endocrinology service and given intravenous calcium replacement ( calcium gluconate 10 mg ) at intervals and intravenous magnesium supplementation . oral calcium replacement and 1 - α - calcidol were subsequently started . long acting cardioselective β - blockers were used to help control the atrial arrhythmia and aspirin instigated for stroke prophylaxis . the qtc was monitored following oral calcium replacement therapy ( fig 4 ) . once the calcium concentration was restored to the normal range , atrial arrhythmias resolved and only sinus rhythm was recorded on holter monitoring .  graph showing improvement in the qtc over time as corrected calcium concentrations improved with oral calcium replacement and 1 - α - calcidol ; the blue legends show the corrected calcium concentration at each qtc .  discussion  while the majority of calcium in the body is within the skeletal system or bound to albumin in plasma , free calcium is tightly controlled by homeostasis effected by parathyroid hormone ( pth ) . transmembrane gradients in calcium concentration drive membrane excitability in muscles , neurones and myocytes . myocardial contraction is dependent on extracellular calcium because the myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum can not store sufficient quantities . as such , prolonged and significant hypocalcaemia can result in heart failure .  among many causes of hypocalcaemia , thyroid surgery , with the inherent risk of parathyroid removal or injury , is a recognised cause of hypoparathyroidism and subsequent hypocalcaemia . patients should undergo long term follow - up to ensure this complication does not present at a later date . here , it presented 23 years after the initial surgery .  acute cardiomyopathies have been induced by hypocalcaemia , and calcium replacement and vitamin d supplementation have been shown to reverse the heart failure . furthermore , renal excretion of sodium is partially dependent on intracellular calcium concentrations , and hypocalcaemia may encourage salt and water retention , exacerbating heart failure . in our patient , a mild left ventricular hypokinesia was noted with chamber dilatation . however , clinical signs of heart failure did not occur and the ejection fraction remained normal .  hypocalcaemia is a recognised cause of qt prolongation via prolongation of the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential . this causes calcium ion channels to remain open for a longer period , allowing a late calcium inflow and the formation of early after - depolarisations . if threshold for depolarisation is reached , new action potentials are induced , initiating a tachycardia and re-entry . ventricular arrhythmias can follow , in particular torsades de pointes ( tdp ; polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ) and ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) . therefore , ventricular arrhythmias are a known complication of hypocalcaemia and patients can present with exertional syncope representing tdp and loss of cardiac output . 7 – 9  in contrast , hypercalcaemia and calcium infusions have been shown to reduce immediately the qtc with shortening of the st segment but prolongation of the t wave ; ventricular ectopics are suppressed but heart block and bradyarrhythmias can occur . 1 , 4 , 5  recent findings suggest that the disordered repolarisation characteristic of subjects with congenital long qt syndrome ( lqts ) occurs in the atria as well as the ventricles . 10 electrophysiological studies showed that congenital lqts patients had altered atrial electrical conduction such that atrial tachyarrhythmias , such as af , were more easily induced and persisted for longer than in normal or other patients with af . 10 these induced episodes of af often had a polymorphic undulating appearance , similar to tdp , and have led to the new term of ‘ atrial torsades de pointes ’ . 10 two large studies have shown that early onset of atrial arrhythmias ( typically af ) is 10-fold higher in those with genetically proven lqts than the general population or matched controls . 11 this coincides with genetic studies that suggest the genes that predispose to lqts ( kcnq1 , kcnh2 and kcna5 encoded potassium channels ) also predispose to atrial arrhythmia in the general population . 11  these new developments raise the possibility that long qtc triggered by acquired causes , as presented here , could create the same electrophysiological state present in congenital lqts which destabilises atrial rhythms to trigger atrial arrhythmia . it is possible that hypocalcaemia prolongs atrial repolarisation and therefore triggers atrial arrhythmias with ‘ atrial torsades de pointes ’ being the underlying abnormality . this mechanism may explain the occurrence of atrial arrhythmia in our patient , though the possibility of a genetic lqts has not formally been excluded . furthermore , formal electrophysiological testing may be required because a 12 lead ecg is unlikely to visualise ‘ atrial torsades de pointes ’ , with most previous reports relying on electrophysiology studies or atrial traces from automated defibrillators .',\n",

year - old right - handed retired male hospital porter presented to the emergency department with an inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint of his right index finger . while putting on his shoes 4 h previously , he experienced a ‘ snap ’ sensation localised within his hand . he was a non-smoker and there was no history of trauma to the hand or systemic disease . he also had no previous procedures to his hand . on examination , there was no palpable mass , significant tenderness or ecchymosis .  investigations  treatment  four days post injury the patient underwent surgical exploration of the suspected closed fdp tendon rupture under general anaesthetic . as the most common site of closed rupture is at the fdp osteotendinous junction , an initial incision was made in flexor zone 1 of the right index finger ( figure 2 ) . the fdp tendon was found to be intact . a second separate incision was made over the a1 pulley and extended proximally where the distal fdp tendon end was found in flexor zone 3 . the proximal fdp end was identified in the carpal tunnel ( figure 3 ) . the fdp tendon was normal on gross examination with no evidence of attrition or other pathology ( figure 3 ) and was therefore not sent for histological examination . the tendon was repaired with a core 4 - strand 3 / 0 prolene adelaide repair and a 6 / 0 prolene epitendinous suture . a dorsal splint in the intrinsic plus position was applied postoperatively .  a second bruner incision was made over the right hand a1 pulley and extended proximally . a third incision was made to retrieve the proximal tendon end in the carpal tunnel . the tendon ends of the flexor digitorum profundus zone 3 rupture are shown post retrieval .  outcome and follow - up  discussion  tendons perform the function of force transfer from muscle to bone to bring about joint movement . longitudinally aligned collagen fibre bundles give tendons high tensile strength . mcmaster 's 2 early work demonstrated that the tendon is the strongest part of the musculotendinous unit . closed flexor tendon ruptures therefore usually occur at their bony insertion .  fdp tendon avulsion injuries are relatively common and occur due to stress concentration at the hard - soft tissue interface . these injuries are also called ‘ jersey fingers ’ , owing to their association with sports , where the flexed distal interphalangeal joint is hyperextended or forcefully flexed against passive extension . these injuries were classified by leddy and packer4 into three types , based on the presence or absence of an avulsed bony fragment and the degree of proximal tendon retraction .  closed ruptures within the substance of the tendon are uncommon . they usually occur secondary to an underlying pathological process such as rheumatoid arthritis . boyes et al1 distinguished a small subgroup of intratendinous ruptures in which no underlying pathological process could be identified , and termed these spontaneous tendon ruptures . these tendon ruptures are rare , with around 60 reported cases in the literature . bois et al5 reviewed 43 such cases and found that 80 % occurred in flexor zone 3 , with the fdp being involved in 82 % of cases . there was a predilection for the little ( 64 % ) , ring ( 14 % ) and middle ( 10 % ) fingers . only 4 % of spontaneous ruptures occurred in the fdp of the index finger . in a recent single centre series , all 12 cases involved the little finger . 6  imbriglia and goldstein7 speculated that the predisposition to spontaneous fdp tendon rupture in the little finger may arise as it absorbs proportionately more stress load through the fdp , with less input from the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon . their series of patients with spontaneous fdp tendon ruptures of the little finger provides an insight into the typical presentation , with all patients describing a ‘ snap ’ or ‘ pop ’ and 90 % carrying out an occupational task involving flexion against resistance at the time of injury . pain was described as minimal to moderate , and occurring in the palm or the finger . the majority of reported cases occur in the dominant hands of middle - aged men who work or have worked in manual jobs , 5 , 6 as in our patient .  the aetiology of these ruptures is likely multifactorial , and microscopic pathology may be present in some cases . kannus and jozsa8 evaluated biopsy specimens from ruptured tendons in various sites including the achilles and biceps tendons . on comparison with healthy age - matched tendons , they found characteristic histopathological patterns such as hypoxic degenerative tendinopathy , mucoid degeneration and calcifying tendinopathy occurring in all ruptured tendons , but only in 34 % of controls . within the flexor tendons specifically , folmar et al9 reviewed 12 ruptures in non-rheumatoid hands , and found that all were likely caused by either intrinsic tendon pathology , or extrinsic pathology such as lunate fracture non-union resulting in attrition rupture . attrition ruptures are , in fact , a separate entity and occur when the tendon frays over a rough bony surface , which can result from trauma , particularly at a site where the carpal bones act as fulcrums for the flexor tendons , such as the fdp tendon of the ring finger on the hook of hamate . 10 a case of tendon rupture secondary to asymptomatic non-union of the hamate hook has been reported , 11 and such asymptomatic pathology may underlie a proportion of spontaneous intratendinous ruptures , although evidence of macroscopic attrition would be expected . anatomical tendon variations have also been cited as possible weak points causing spontaneous rupture , such as at the bifurcation of a common fdp tendon to the ring and little fingers . 12  although our patient had a good outcome , the lack of preoperative investigations such as ultrasound or mri resulted in an unnecessary initial distal incision . unnecessary incisions can increase the risk of adverse scarring , postoperative flexion contractures and injury to underlying neurovascular structures during dissection . radiographs are routinely used , but will only accurately demonstrate the presence of an avulsed bony segment , and can miss tiny fragments . ultrasound findings in closed flexor tendon injuries have been shown to correlate with surgical findings 14 and are more accurate than physical examination alone . mri has been shown to accurately depict the location of tendon rupture and the gap between tendon ends . 16 we propose that preoperative imaging such as ultrasound should be used to determine the site of injury in closed flexor tendon injuries where there is no clear evidence of an avulsion injury .\",\n",

       "   'paragraphs': [{'context': \"summary  necrotising fasciitis ( nf ) is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection involving necrosis of subcutaneous tissues . early surgical intervention reduces mortality , but initial clinical findings are often non-specific and can delay the diagnosis . an 80 - year - old patient , presented to our emergency department with pain in her left hip and mild bruising following a fall . an x-ray , requested to investigate a possible hip fracture , in fact demonstrated air in the subcutaneous tissues . she rapidly deteriorated and soon developed blood - filled blisters , crepitus and fixed staining of the skin . she underwent urgent debridement of involved tissues in theatre confirming the diagnosis of nf . the presence of subcutaneous emphysema on plain radiograph as in this case , is extremely specific to the diagnosis of nf . although other imaging modalities can aid diagnosis these remain as an adjunct rather than a definitive diagnostic tool and should not delay surgical intervention based on clinical findings .  background  necrotising soft tissue infections are rare and are rapidly progressive , often proving fatal . although the incidence of necrotising fasciitis ( nf ) is low at approximately 500 cases / year in the uk , 1 death rates can be as high as 76 % . early surgical intervention has been shown to reduce mortality ; 2 , 3 however , initial clinical findings are often non-specific and can contribute to delays in diagnosis . this case in particular demonstrates how the presentation can be extremely varied and atypical and therefore a high index of clinical suspicion is needed and any clues to the diagnosis must be noted and acted upon as a matter of urgency .  case presentation  an 80 - year - old lady , with a background of insulin - dependent diabetes , presented to our local emergency department with a 1 - day history of left hip pain . the pain was insidious in onset but increased in intensity throughout the day and culminated in the patients ’ leg giving way and being helped to the ground by her daughter . on admission the patient appeared pale and clearly in distress , although cardiovascular parameters were normal ( blood pressure 104 / 60 ; pulse 82 ) and clinical examination only identified mild bruising to the medial aspect of the left upper thigh . initial investigations were requested and the patient was reviewed 2 h later by the emergency team . at this stage , the attending clinician noted extension of the bruising down to the calf with blood - filled blisters and surgical crepitus . there was fixed staining of the skin on the posterior and medial aspect of the left leg .  investigations  initial blood tests showed a white cell count of 8.9 × 109 / l , neutrophils of 8.2 × 109 / l , c reactive protein of 51 mg / l and lactate of 4.9 which rose to 7.8 mmol / l within an hour ( although the ph on arterial blood gas remained neutral as a result of respiratory compensation ) . plain x-rays demonstrated air in the subcutaneous tissue of the left thigh and hip ( figures 1 and 2 ) . gram staining of debrided tissue sent for immediate histological review showed the presence of gram - positive cocci , later confirmed as group a streptococcus . the nf was probably caused by the bacteria entering through broken skin attributable to the patients ’ poor diabetic control . however , due to the often rapid progression of nf , the source of bacteraemia and subsequent sepsis is sometimes difficult to confirm .  differential diagnosis  the provisional diagnosis , based on the history of trauma and pain in the hip was of a fractured neck of femur . however , with the rapid development of severe bruising , subcutaneous crepitus and blood - filled blisters , it became clear that nf was the likely diagnosis . possible differential diagnoses were cellulitis or subcutaneous abscess ; however , the above clinical findings , blood tests and x-rays made a diagnosis of nf almost unequivocal .  treatment  the patient was started on intravenous antibiotics and was taken directly from accident and emergency to theatre where she underwent urgent surgical debridement of the left leg . skin from the medial , lateral and posterior aspects of the left thigh and medial and posterior calf were debrided until only healthy , bleeding skin edges remained . resuscitation was initiated in the intensive care unit involving extensive inotropic support , however , the patients ’ lactic acidosis continued to rise and although further necrotic tissue was noted , she was deemed too unwell for further surgical intervention , particularly as the first debridement had been so extensive . the patient died of sepsis and multiorgan failure 24 h later .  outcome and follow - up  despite the gold standard treatment of broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and extensive surgical debridement being initiated at an early juncture , the slight delay until clinical findings became more apparent meant that the systemic toxicity associated with group a streptococcus infection , had already taken hold . the patients ’ age and comorbid diabetic status also contributed to her poor prognosis and she died on the intensive care unit after 48 h of substantial resuscitation efforts .  discussion  nf is a life - threatening and rapidly progressing infection that spreads along fascial planes . it is usually caused by streptococcal organisms , but often a variety of both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens are grown from culture . in particular group a β - haemolytic strains are believed to cause a more profound systemic sepsis . production of bacterial toxins and enzymes , such as hyaluronidase , cause rapid progression of the infection through the fascia . which undergoes liquefactive necrosis . as further bacterial proliferation and necrosis occur , occlusion and suppuration of blood vessels lead to evolving skin ischaemia .  although a history of trauma is usually present such as a scratch or bite , 6 often no cause can be established . nf can occur following surgery , intravenous drug use , burns and childbirth , and can complicate soft tissue infections . factors that render patients susceptible to nf include any chronic disease or comorbid condition that could suppress the immune system including malignancy , malnutrition , obesity , immunosuppressive drugs or as in this case , diabetes . 8 , 9  early signs and symptoms include fever , pain , swelling , erythema , tenderness and cellulitis . 10 crepitus , blisters and haemorrhagic bullae are late but more focal signs . the presence of subcutaneous emphysema on plain radiograph , as seen in this case report , is a very specific finding for nf . 12 one or more of crepitus , blistering and subcutaneous emphysema on plain x-ray can be seen in 85 % of cases , and this triad of signs has been suggested as a screening tool . soft tissue air on x-ray alone is not completely sensitive for infection , and nf can be present where subcutaneous emphysema is absent . presentations are variable and while the symptoms and signs listed provide some diagnostic assistance , the most important point to note during clinical examination is severe pain disproportionate to local findings in association with systemic toxicity . also of note , the skin involved becomes increasingly tense as the erythematous margins become indistinct , and the colour of the skin normally progresses from a red - purple to a dusky blue before the occurrence of bullae / blisters . symptoms may develop over a period of hours to days and presentations are varied , some patients presenting already confused or agitated due to systemic shock thus increasing the diagnostic difficulty for the clinician . 15  in addition to plain radiography , a variety of imaging techniques have been utilised to assist in the diagnosis of nf , particularly where clinical uncertainty exists .  ultrasound : demonstrates features of diffuse thickening of subcutaneous tissue and fluid accumulation along deep fascial planes , with specificities and sensitivities of up to 93 % and 88 % , respectively . 16  ct : ct findings in nf include thickening of fascia , subcutaneous emphysema , fluid collections and non-enhancing fascia indicating the presence of necrosis . it has also been shown to detect air missed on plain radiograph , particularly where present in deeper tissues . 19  mri : unlike ct , soft tissue air is less easily identifiable on mri and can be mistaken for calcification or a metallic foreign body . 18 however , mri has high soft tissue contrast and can demonstrate the extent of tissue involvement in necrotising infections . 18 , 20  although routine blood tests and various imaging techniques can help the clinician to differentiate nf from other conditions , the diagnosis is primarily based on clinical findings . if a high suspicion exists then additional tests such as ct or mri should be avoided so as not to delay treatment which would subsequently worsen the outcome . simple tests such as blood gas analysis showing an acidosis and high lactate levels are strongly associated with nf and will not delay surgical intervention .  immediate resuscitation and broad - spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be initiated alongside early involvement of the surgical team who should proceed directly to theatre for urgent debridement . surgeons should make incisions to the deep fascia ( this will often reveal the presence of ‘ murky dishwater fluid ’ in the wound ) , and all non-viable tissue including fascia should be excised . further surgical exploration 24 – 48 h later is mandatory to ensure that the infectious process has not extended . repeated debridements may be necessary ( as dictated by the condition of the wound ) until the infection has been controlled adequately — in one study of 30 patients with nf in the central portion of the body ( including the thighs ) , 6 ( 20 % ) patients died and the survivors each underwent between 2 and 4 debridements . haemorrhage is not uncommon after debridement , and in cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation such bleeds can be difficult to control . whole blood and clotting products should always be available for the patient prior to surgery . 15 early recognition of nf followed by urgent referral to surgeons , microbiologists and intensive care and subsequent prompt surgical intervention has helped to decrease the mortality from over 70 % to approximately 20 % . aggressive debridement aims to excise all necrotic tissue up to healthy bleeding margins and urgent microbiological analysis of this tissue and of any ‘ murky dishwater fluid ’ can help to tailor antibiotics . postoperatively patients should be managed on the intensive care unit where they often require physiological support from the ensuing overwhelming systemic compromise . further debridement may be carried out in theatres after 24 – 48 h to ensure excision of all necrotic tissue . once fully recovered from the infection , closure and reconstruction of the wound can be planned .  the presentation of an elderly patient with groin pain after a fall may have led to a preliminary differential diagnosis of a hip fracture in this case . however , the rapid progression to systemic compromise with significant skin changes , a high lactate and subcutaneous gas on plain radiography were all in fact classical features of nf emphasising that although other conditions must always be considered , nf will almost invariably have a typical presentation . there are several case reports of underlying pathology such as ludwig 's angina , sigmoid perforation or psoas abscess presenting as nf21 – 23 but there are no case reports in the literature where nf has presented in an atypical manner which is reassuring for clinicians needing to make the critically important rapid diagnosis of the condition . the accident and emergency staff recognised very early that this was a case of nf and it is unlikely that debridement and intravenous antibiotics could have been instigated any earlier . unfortunately the patients ’ age and comorbidities together with the particularly rapid progression of the nf in this case contributed to the unsuccessful outcome .\",\n",

( f ) the enterprise stent is completely deployed , and after confirming successful placement , the balloon is withdrawn . the coils have returned completely within the aneurysm sac ( arrow ) , supported in place by the stent scaffolding .  case presentation  case no 1 was a wide neck left internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysm , measuring 9 mm × 7.9 mm × 6 mm with a 5 mm neck ( figure 2 ) . case no 2 was a complex left superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm , measuring 5.3 mm × 4 mm × 5 mm with a 2.9 mm neck ( figure 3 ) . case no 3 was a ruptured right posterior communicating artery aneurysm , measuring 4 mm × 4 mm × 4.5 mm with a 4 mm neck ( figure 4 ) . case details and outcomes are provided in their respective figure legends .  case no 1 . a patient with a wide necked left superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm , measuring 5.3 mm × 4 mm × 5 mm with a 3 mm neck , found after workup for headaches ( a ) . balloon assisted embolization of the left superior hypophyseal aneurysm was done with a transform supercompliant balloon ( stryker ) and sl - 10 microcatheter ( stryker ) . a single round of coil packing noted a dense coil mass , with no apparent herniation ( b ) . multiple attempts at balloon deflation led to notable coil mass prolapse , and consequently the balloon was reinflated ( c ) . the coil mass stabilized with balloon reinflation , and concurrent deployment of the enterprise stent with balloon deflation led to excellent expansion of the stent without further coil mass migration ( d ) . the final run showed raymond grade ii 98 % embolization ( e ) . at the 3 month follow - up , there was no in - stent stenosis . a stable coil mass with improved apposition of the prior coil loop against the stent wall was visualized . there was no recanalization seen .  case no 2 . an elderly patient with multiple medical comorbidities presented with hunt and hess grade 3 , 5 days after rupture of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm , measuring 4 mm × 4 mm × 4.5 mm with a 4 mm neck . initial angiography already noted the development of vasospasm in the right a1 segments which was treated with intra-arterial verapamil . the patient also had three unruptured aneurysms : right pericallosal , right anterior communicating , and right middle cerebral . ( a ) balloon assisted embolization was done with a transform supercompliant balloon ( stryker ) and sl - 10 microcatheter ( stryker ) , resulting in a dense coil mass with excellent obliteration of the aneurysm . ( b ) the sl - 10 was removed , and three attempts were made to deflate the balloon . each time a single coil loop prolapse was noted , and consequently the balloon was reinflated ( c ) . with the balloon inflated , the stent microcatheter was positioned adjacent and partly distal to the balloon ( d ) . the enterprise stent was deployed in the described dynamic manner with excellent apposition to the parent vessel wall . after bailout stent remodeling of the coil mass , final angiography showed raymond grade i embolization , with some coil interstices filling with contrast but excellent dome protection . additionally , no stenosis or embolic complication was observed ( e ) . this patient underwent an emergent embolization with stent bailout deployment , and was given a bolus dose of eptifibatide 10 000 µg at balloon deflation / stent deployment followed by a 1 µg / kg / min infusion for 6 h . the patient was also started on aspirin 600 mg rectally , plavix 400 mg via a nasogastric tube , and started on aspirin 325 mg and plavix 75 mg daily . three days after bailout – stent embolization , the patient deteriorated with worsened vasospasm on ct angiography . the patient was brought back for an angiogram and found to have moderate vasospasm of the right anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries . intra-arterial verapamil was again administered with improvement on angiogram , and with a stable appearance of the coil mass and no evidence of thrombus or in - stent stenosis ( not shown ) . five days post- embolization the patient experienced a spontaneous large retroperitoneal hematoma resulting in severe hypotension . while this was rapidly corrected , multisystem organ failure developed ( likely secondary to the episode of severe hypotension ) and the family elected for comfort care . the experience of this case further supports the position of avoiding stent placement if at all possible in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage . bailout stent remodeling was felt to be a reasonable option given the delayed presentation and lack of hydrocephalus . however , it is likely that aspirin and plavix contributed to the retroperitoneal hematoma and , as a result , likely contributed to eventual death .  case no 3 . a patient with a wide neck left internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysm , measuring 9 mm × 7.9 mm × 6 mm with a 5 mm neck , presented with transient ischemic attack symptoms of unclear origin . balloon assisted embolization was undertaken . balloon assisted embolization of the left internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysm was undertaken with a transform supercompliant 7 mm × 10 mm balloon ( stryker ) and sl - 10 microcatheter ( stryker ) . during balloon deflation after two rounds of balloon assisted embolization , the coil mass had herniated into the parent vessel . the balloon was immediately reinflated and a prowler select plus microcatheter ( codman ) was exchanged over a synchro standard microwire ( stryker ) and brought behind the inflated balloon ( a ) . next , the enterprise stent system was deployed with concurrent deflation of the transform balloon ; note the distal stent tines are seen ( b ) . after bailout stent remodeling of the coil mass , final angiography showed raymond grade ii 98 % embolization , excellent remodeling of the parent vessel , and no coil mass herniation ( not shown ) . the 3 month follow - up angiography demonstrated raymond grade i 100 % embolization with no in - stent stenosis ( c , d ) .  treatment  in all cases we used the conglomerate mass technique , as initially described by fiorella and woo , 9 wherein a temporary balloon is positioned across the aneurysm neck and inflated followed by several rounds of embolization , with multiple coils placed during inflation to create a fixed coil mass . typically , a stable well formed coil mass is very stable on completion of this technique ; however , as the reported cases illustrate , this is not always the case . after balloon assisted coil embolization of the aneurysm and removal of the microcatheter , the balloon is slowly deflated . if coil herniation is seen , the balloon is quickly reinflated to prevent further coil migration and embolization .  in the simultaneous balloon deflation / stent expansion bailout technique , a prowler select plus microcatheter ( codman and shurtleff inc ) is advanced over an 0.014 inch microwire to cross parallel to the balloon into the distal vasculature using a gentle spinning technique . all of our cases used the transform balloon ( stryker neurovascular , fremont , california , usa ) for balloon remodeling . in all cases there was no difficulty advancing the prowler select plus microcatheter past the transform balloon through the neuron 070 ( penumbra , alameda , california , usa ) guide catheter , next , the enterprise stent is deployed starting just distal to the still inflated balloon and aneurysm neck . as the balloon is slowly deflated , simultaneous expansion of the stent is seen . in all cases the coils were visualized to stay within the aneurysm without further movement . the enterprise stent is noted to have good apposition to the vessel wall , and the fully deflated balloon is withdrawn ( figure 1 ) . we encountered no significant resistance in withdrawal of the balloon despite its location being between the stent and the vessel wall . we believe that the closed cell design of the enterprise stent is critical to the easy withdrawal of the deflated balloon .  to prevent acute thrombosis with stenting , all patients were given antithrombotics . for the patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage , immediately prior to balloon deflation the patient was given an intravenous loading dose of eptifibatide followed by a 6 h infusion , and aspirin 300 mg rectally ; plavix 400 mg via a nasogastric tube was administered prior to extubation . rectal aspirin was used for its more rapid absorption profile . in the two elective patients , pretreatment as outpatients with aspirin and plavix occurred , given the wide neck nature of their aneurysms and potential need for stent placement . however , once the intraprocedural decision was made for balloon remodeling , deployment of stent occurred as a bailout given the coil mass migration . all patients were given intraprocedural boluses of heparin with a target activated clotting time of 200 – 250 s . there were no incidents of acute thromboembolic complications .  discussion  in large modern series using detachable coils , the incidence of coil prolapse or migration has ranged from 1.2 % to 2.5 % . retrieval using devices such as stent retrievers and snare devices has been the most commonly used technique when embolization occurs . stent assisted remodeling has been reported , particularly when retrieval fails . fessler et al4 first described one case of trapping the migrated / fractured coil between the stent and endothelium of the parent vessel . this has been described in five other cases with favorable results . 5 – 7  yoo et al8 first described using the neuroform stent to rescue herniated loops in 16 aneurysm cases . satisfactory stabilization of the coils was achieved in 12 / 16 ( 75 % ) cases . the described technique is one of serial stent placement only , after coiling or balloon remodeling . only four cases in total used balloon inflation , three cases involved balloon use during the initial aneurysm embolization , and one case attempted balloon remodeling , prior to stent placement . while this series is the best described series of stent assisted molding of coil mass back into the aneurysm , yoo 's technique is one of serial stent placement after coiling or balloon remodeling , rather than ours of simultaneous stent deployment during balloon deflation after coiling .  while stent placement to stabilize a coil mass is not new , the important technical note highlighted in our series is that when there is fear of immediate mobilization of coils during balloon deflation , it is technically feasible to access the parent vasculature through the existing access system and simultaneously deploy a stent and deflate the balloon . we demonstrated that through the same 0.070 guide catheter , with the transform balloon in place , an 0.021 catheter can be simultaneously brought up into the vasculature to cross the aneurysm neck and then deploy a closed cell stent prior to balloon deflation , thereby effecting simultaneous stent inflation during balloon deflation . no additional groin puncture or guide catheter is necessary in our technique , saving valuable time and further reducing thromboembolic risk .  it is critical to note that a closed cell stent with robust opening force is crucial to the successful employment of this technique . the enterprise stent ( codman and shurtleff inc ) is especially suited to the simultaneous bailout stent technique due to its closed cell design and greater radial force than the neuroform stent . this allows one to effectively ‘ jail ’ the balloon outside of the stent , without concern for the balloon getting caught on the tynes of an open cell design . we experienced no resistance in withdrawing the balloon during any of our cases , and observed no evidence of stent migration with balloon withdrawal . we would emphasize that the distal edge of the stent must be deployed distal to the end of the balloon to avoid the risk of the balloon catching on the distal end of the stent . furthermore , having the stent deployed distal to the balloon provides a benefit by creating distal protection from embolization should any coils herniate despite the use of this technique .  other techniques that exist for practitioners to consider when faced with coil herniation include deflation of the balloon after the coil is brought into position , but prior to final detachment . this can allow for direct visualization , and if the coil can not be stabilized , then the coil can still be resheathed and a stent assisted coiling technique similar to yoo et al can be utilized . another technique is to use a double microcatheter technique to place simultaneous coils or alternating from one microcatheter to the other , which can allow for increased stability for wide neck aneurysms . 11 should these preventative measures fail to secure the coil mass , or if they are not employed initially , then our described simultaneous stent bailout technique can be readily utilized through the existing vasculature access .  balloon remodeling has become a popular option in aneurysm coil embolization , but coils can prolapse during balloon deflation , particularly in wide neck aneurysms . in these cases , the simultaneous stent bailout technique allows for simultaneous deployment across the neck with concurrent balloon deflation to stabilize the coil mass and prevent unnecessary coil prolapse or migration . however , this technique is not without risks . any time a stent is placed there is a risk of acute thrombosis or in - stent stenosis . each center has its own protocol for providing appropriate antiplatelet therapy prior to urgent stent placement , and our case number is too small to advocate any particular management paradigm . with regards to delayed in - stent stenosis , the documented incidence in a large registry of enterprise stent coiling was 3.4 % . 12  on follow - up angiography , none of our patients demonstrated any significant in - stent stenosis . additionally , in no cases were any instances of thromboembolic complications identified . finally , this experience further highlights the risks associated with stent assisted coiling in ruptured aneurysm patients . while the technical components of the simultaneous stent bailout technique proceeded without difficulty , the patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage died from a delayed retroperitoneal hematoma a week later that likely was at least worsened as a result of the patient 's double antiplatelet therapy .\",\n",

dako cytomation , glostrup , denmark ) and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against spirochete infected tissue ( zytomed systems , berlin , germany ) in a dilution of 1 : 100 . stainings were performed using the dako instrument autostainer plus and stained with the dako real detection system alkaline phosphatase / red - conjugated anti-rabbit anti-mouse antibody ( k5005 ) . sections were examined by light microscopy and showed an acanthotic broadened epidermis with spongiform infiltration of neutrophil leukocytes adjacent to a deep epidermal defect ( figure 3 ) . some plasma cells were present within the infiltrate . immunohistochemical staining revealed t pallidum in the upper part of the ulceration and in the subepidermal part of the ulcer margin ( figure 4 ) .  differential diagnosis  differential diagnosis includes drug eruptions , presenting as maculopapulous exanthema , pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta , disseminated herpes or varizella zoster infections , ulcerating forms of vasculitis or pyoderma .  the results from histological examination in combination with serological investigation proved lues maligna and ruled out all differential diagnoses .  treatment  the patient was treated with penicillin g 10 million iu intravenously three times daily for 21 days . supportive single dose steroid treatment ( 100 mg prednisolone intravenous ) was administered for prevention of jarisch – herxheimer reaction .  outcome and follow - up  discussion  lues maligna ( lm ) is a rare manifestation of secondary syphilis , first and independently described in 1897 by neisser1 and haslund . lm is predominantly found in patients with immunodeficiency such as hiv or aids , but has also been reported in patients with chronic alcohol or drug abuse , tuberculosis or diabetes mellitus . 3 , – , 6 lm may also present with ocular manifestations such as scleral nodules and keratitis or with leonine facies . such symptoms were not present in our patient . in the decades before hiv and aids , the frequency of lm was very low ( 0.12 – 0.36 % ) and until 1994 only about two dozen of cases with lm had been described in the english - language literature . since then , the incidence of lm has been rising steadily according to an increase of lues in general . patients with lm usually show generalised swollen lymph nodes , whereas an involvement of internal organs is uncommon . about one half of all patients with lm show cerebrospinal fluid alterations but do not present neurological symptoms like the patient presented here . intravenously applied penicillin g for 14 – 21 days , an effective treatment of lm , can be considered as state - of - the - art treatment for patients with lm and hiv or aids .  in conclusion , secondary syphilis may present as lm especially in hiv - co- infected homosexual men and should therefore be included in the list of differential diagnoses in patients presenting with ulceronodular exanthema with or without ulcerous mucocutaneous lesions . finally , one should be aware of the old dictum ‘ omnis syphiliticus mendax ( est ) ’ , that reflects that , the treating physician can never be sure that , the case history reported by the patient is in accordance with the facts , especially when concerning the patients sexual history . 10',\n",
